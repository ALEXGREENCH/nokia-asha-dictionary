Syn.
 -- Also, Likewise, Too. These words are used by way of transition,
in leaving one thought and passing to another. Also is the widest
term. It denotes that what follows is all so, or entirely like that
which preceded, or may be affirmed with the same truth; as, "If you
were there, I was there also;" "If our situation has some
discomforts, it has also many sources of enjoyment." Too is simply
less formal and pointed than also; it marks the transition with a
lighter touch; as, "I was there too;" "a courtier yet a patriot too."

thought by some to be more specific than also. "It implies," says
Whately, "some connection or agreement between the words it unites.
We may say, ` He is a poet, and likewise a musician; ' but we should
not say, ` He is a prince, and likewise a musician,' because there is
no natural connection between these qualities." This distinction,
