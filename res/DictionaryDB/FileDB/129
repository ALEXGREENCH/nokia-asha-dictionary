argument. I. Watts.

brought in; and hence, a deduction or induction from premises, --
something which follows as certainly or probably true. A conclusion
is stronger than an inference; it shuts us up to the result, and
terminates inquiry. We infer what is particular or probable; we
conclude what is certain. In a chain of reasoning we have many
inferences, which lead to the ultimate conclusion. "An inference is a
proposition which is perceived to be true, because of its connection
with some known fact." "When something is simply affirmed to be true,
it is called a proposition; after it has been found to be true by
several reasons or arguments, it is called a conclusion." I. Taylor.

authority of Christianity; a Mohammedan; a heathen; a freethinker.

Note: Infidel is used by English writers to translate the equivalent
word used Mohammedans in speaking of Christians and other
disbelievers in Mohammedanism.

Syn.
 -- Infidel, Unbeliever, Freethinker, Deist, Atheist, Sceptic,
Agnostic. An infidel, in common usage, is one who denies Christianity
and the truth of the Scriptures. Some have endeavored to widen the
sense of infidel so as to embrace atheism and every form of unbelief;
but this use does not generally prevail. A freethinker is now only
another name for an infidel. An unbeliever is not necessarily a
disbeliever or infidel, because he may still be inquiring after
evidence to satisfy his mind; the word, however, is more commonly
used in the extreme sense. A deist believes in one God and a divine
providence, but rejects revelation. An atheist denies the being of
God. A sceptic is one whose faith in the credibility of evidence is
weakened or destroyed, so that religion, to the same extent, has no
practical hold on his mind. An agnostic remains in a state of
suspended judgment, neither affirming nor denying the existence of a
personal Deity.

Finite.]

1. Unlimited or boundless, in time or space; as, infinite duration or

Infinite.]

Defn: Unlimited; not bounded or restricted; undefined. Infinitive
mood (Gram.), that form of the verb which merely names the action,
and performs the office of a verbal noun. Some grammarians make two
forms in English: (a) The simple form, as, speak, go, hear, before
which to is commonly placed, as, to speak; to go; to hear. (b) The
form of the imperfect participle, called the infinitive in -ing; as,
going is as easy as standing.

Note: With the auxiliary verbs may, can, must, might, could, would,
and should, the simple infinitive is expressed without to; as, you
may speak; they must hear, etc. The infinitive usually omits to with
the verbs let, dare, do, bid, make, see, hear, need, etc.; as, let me
go; you dare not tell; make him work; hear him talk, etc.

Note: In Anglo-Saxon, the simple infinitive was not preceded by to
(the sign of modern simple infinitive), but it had a dative form
(sometimes called the gerundial infinitive) which was preceded by to,
and was chiefly employed in expressing purpose. See Gerund, 2.

Note: The gerundial ending (-anne) not only took the same form as the
simple infinitive (-an), but it was confounded with the present
participle in -ende, or -inde (later -inge).

the varying element which enters it. Davies & Peck (Math. Dict. ).
