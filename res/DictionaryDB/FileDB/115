1. (Anat.)

Defn: A hollow, muscular organ, which, by contracting rhythmically,
keeps up the circulation of the blood.
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart! Shak.

Note: In adult mammals and birds, the heart is four-chambered, the
right auricle and ventricle being completely separated from the left
auricle and ventricle; and the blood flows from the systematic veins
to the right auricle, thence to the right ventricle, from which it is
forced to the lungs, then returned to the left auricle, thence passes
to the left ventricle, from which it is driven into the systematic
arteries. See Illust. under Aorta. In fishes there are but one
auricle and one ventricle, the blood being pumped from the ventricle
through the gills to the system, and thence returned to the auricle.
In most amphibians and reptiles, the separation of the auricles is
partial or complete, and in reptiles the ventricles also are
separated more or less completely. The so-called lymph hearts, found
in many amphibians, reptiles, and birds, are contractile sacs, which
pump the lymph into the veins.
