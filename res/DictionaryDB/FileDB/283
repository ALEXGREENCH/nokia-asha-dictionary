willeo, willio, D. wil, G. wille, Icel. vili, Dan. villie, Sw. vilja,
Goth wilja. See Will, v.]

1. The power of choosing; the faculty or endowment of the soul by
which it is capable of choosing; the faculty or power of the mind by
which we decide to do or not to do; the power or faculty of
preferring or selecting one of two or more objects.
It is necessary to form a distinct notion of what is meant by the
word "volition" in order to understand the import of the word will,
for this last word expresses the power of mind of which "volition" is
the act. Stewart.
Will is an ambiguous word, being sometimes put for the faculty of
willing; sometimes for the act of that faculty, besides [having]
other meanings. But "volition" always signifies the act of willing,
and nothing else. Reid.
Appetite is the will's solicitor, and the will is appetite's
controller; what we covet according to the one, by the other we often
reject. Hooker.
The will is plainly that by which the mind chooses anything. J.
Edwards.

2. The choice which is made; a determination or preference which
results from the act or exercise of the power of choice; a volition.
The word "will," however, is not always used in this its proper
acceptation, but is frequently substituted for "volition", as when I
say that my hand mover in obedience to my will. Stewart.

3. The choice or determination of one who has authority; a decree; a
command; discretionary pleasure.
Thy will be done. Matt. vi. 10.
Our prayers should be according to the will of God. Law.

4. Strong wish or inclination; desire; purpose.

Note: "Inclination is another word with which will is frequently
confounded. Thus, when the apothecary says, in Romeo and Juliet, --
My poverty, but not my will, consents; . . . Put this in any liquid
thing you will, And drink it off. the word will is plainly used as,
synonymous with inclination; not in the strict logical sense, as the
immediate antecedent of action. It is with the same latitude that the
word is used in common conversation, when we speak of doing a thing
which duty prescribes, against one's own will; or when we speak of
doing a thing willingly or unwillingly." Stewart.

5. That which is strongly wished or desired.
What's your will, good friar Shak.
The mariner hath his will. Coleridge.

6. Arbitrary disposal; power to control, dispose, or determine.
Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies. Ps. xxvii. 12.

7
7 (Law)

Defn: The legal declaration of a person's mind as to the manner in
which he would have his property or estate disposed of after his
death; the written instrument, legally executed, by which a man makes
disposition of his estate, to take effect after his death; testament;
devise. See the Note under Testament, 1.

Note: Wills are written or nuncupative, that is, oral. See
Nuncupative will, under Nuncupative. At will (Law), at pleasure. To
hold an estate at the will of another, is to enjoy the possession at
his pleasure, and be liable to be ousted at any time by the lessor or
proprietor. An estate at will is at the will of both parties.
 -- Good will. See under Good.
 -- Ill will, enmity; unfriendliness; malevolence.
 -- To have one's will, to obtain what is desired; to do what one
pleases.
 -- Will worship, worship according to the dictates of the will or
fancy; formal worship. [Obs.] -- Will worshiper, one who offers will
worship. [Obs.] Jer. Taylor.
 -- With a will, with willingness and zeal; with all one's heart or
strength; earnestly; heartily.

WILL
Will, v. t. & auxiliary. [imp. Would. Indic. present, I will (Obs. I
wol), thou wilt, he will (Obs. he wol); we, ye, they will.] Etym:
[OE. willen, imp. wolde; akin to OS. willan, OFries. willa, D.
willen, G. wollen, OHG. wollan, wellan, Icel. & Sw. vilja, Dan.
ville, Goth. wiljan, OSlav. voliti, L. velle to wish, volo I wish;
cf. Skr. vrs to choose, to prefer. Cf. Voluntary, Welcome, Well,
adv.]

1. To wish; to desire; to incline to have.
A wife as of herself no thing ne sholde [should] Wille in effect, but
as her husband wolde [would]. Chaucer.
Caleb said unto her, What will thou Judg. i. 14.
They would none of my counsel. Prov. i. 30.

2. As an auxiliary, will is used to denote futurity dependent on the
verb. Thus, in first person, "I will" denotes willingness, consent,
promise; and when "will" is emphasized, it denotes determination or
fixed purpose; as, I will go if you wish; I will go at all hazards.
In the second and third persons, the idea of distinct volition, wish,
or purpose is evanescent, and simple certainty is appropriately
expressed; as, "You will go," or "He will go," describes a future
event as a fact only. To emphasize will denotes (according to the
tone or context) certain futurity or fixed determination.

Note: Will, auxiliary, may be used elliptically for will go. "I'll to
her lodgings." Marlowe.

Note: As in shall (which see), the second and third persons may be
virtually converted into the first, either by question or indirect
statement, so as to receive the meaning which belongs to will in that
person; thus, "Will you go" (answer, "I will go") asks assent,
requests, etc.; while "Will he go" simply inquires concerning
futurity; thus, also,"He says or thinks he will go," "You say or
think you will go," both signify willingness or consent.

Note: Would, as the preterit of will, is chiefly employed in
conditional, subjunctive, or optative senses; as, he would go if he
could; he could go if he would; he said that he would go; I would
fain go, but can not; I would that I were young again; and other like
phrases. In the last use, the first personal pronoun is often
omitted; as, would that he were here; would to Heaven that it were
so; and, omitting the to in such an adjuration. "Would God I had died
for thee." Would is used for both present and future time, in
conditional propositions, and would have for past time; as, he would
go now if he were ready; if it should rain, he would not go; he would
have gone, had he been able. Would not, as also will not, signifies
refusal. "He was angry, and would not go in." Luke xv. 28. Would is
never a past participle.

Note: In Ireland, Scotland, and the United States, especially in the
southern and western portions of the United States, shall and will,
should and would, are often misused, as in the following examples: --
I am able to devote as much time and attention to other subjects as I
will [shall] be under the necessity of doing next winter. Chalmers.
A countryman, telling us what he had seen, remarked that if the
conflagration went on, as it was doing, we would [should] have, as
our next season's employment, the Old Town of Edinburgh to rebuild.
H. Miller.
I feel assured that I will [shall] not have the misfortune to find
conflicting views held by one so enlightened as your excellency. J.
Y. Mason.

WILL
Will, v. i.

Defn: To be willing; to be inclined or disposed; to be pleased; to
wish; to desire.
And behold, there came a leper and worshiped him, saying, Lord if
thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus . . . touched him,
saying, I will; be thou clean. Matt. viii. 2, 3.

Note: This word has been confused with will, v. i., to choose, which,
unlike this, is of the weak conjugation. Will I, nill I, or Will ye,
hill ye, or Will he, nill he, whether I, you, or he will it or not;
hence, without choice; compulsorily; -- sometimes corrupted into
willy nilly. "If I must take service willy nilly." J. H. Newman.
"Land for all who would till it, and reading and writing will ye,
nill ye." Lowell.

WILL
Will, v. t. [imp. & p. p Willed; p. pr. & vb. n. Willing. Indic.

of the spirit. Wyclif (1 Cor. ii. 13).
Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil
is understanding. Job xxviii. 28.

Syn.
 -- Prudence; knowledge. Wisdom, Prudence, Knowledge. Wisdom has been
defined to be "the use of the best means for attaining the best
ends." "We conceive," says Whewell, " prudence as the virtue by which
we select right means for given ends, while wisdom implies the
selection of right ends as well as of right means." Hence, wisdom
implies the union of high mental and moral excellence. Prudence (that
is, providence, or forecast) is of a more negative character; it
rather consists in avoiding danger than in taking decisive measures
for the accomplishment of an object. Sir Robert Walpole was in many
respects a prudent statesman, but he was far from being a wise one.
Burke has said that prudence, when carried too far, degenerates into
a "reptile virtue," which is the more dangerous for its plausible
appearance. Knowledge, a more comprehensive term, signifies the
simple apprehension of facts or relations. "In strictness of
language," says Paley, " there is a difference between knowledge and
wisdom; wisdom always supposing action, and action directed by it."
Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one, Have ofttimes no
connection. Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other
men; Wisdom, in minds attentive to their own. Knowledge, a rude,
unprofitable mass, The mere materials with which wisdom builds, Till
smoothed, and squared, and fitted to its place, Does but encumber
whom it seems to enrich. Knowledge is proud that he has learned so
much; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more. Cowper.
Wisdom tooth, the last, or back, tooth of the full set on each half
of each jaw in man; -- familiarly so called, because appearing
comparatively late, after the person may be supposed to have arrived
at the age of wisdom. See the Note under Tooth, 1.

later Hellenistic reflective writing beginning with Philo Judæus.
