Syn.
 -- Incident; occurrence; adventure; issue; result; termination;
consequence; conclusion.
 -- Event, Occurrence, Incident, Circumstance. An event denotes that
which arises from a preceding state of things. Hence we speak or
watching the event; of tracing the progress of events. An occurrence
has no reference to any antecedents, but simply marks that which
meets us in our progress through life, as if by chance, or in the
course of divine providence. The things which thus meet us, if
important, are usually connected with antecedents; and hence event is
the leading term. In the "Declaration of Independence" it is said,
"When, in the cource of human events, it becomes necessary." etc.
Here, occurrences would be out of place. An incident is that which
falls into a state of things to which is does not primarily belong;
as, the incidents of a journey. The term is usually applied to things
of secondary importance. A circumstance is one of the things
surrounding us in our path of life. These may differ greatly in
importance; but they are always outsiders, which operate upon us from
without, exerting greater or less influence according to their
intrinsic importance. A person giving an account of a campaign might
dwell on the leading events which it produced; might mention some of
its striking occurrences; might allude to some remarkable incidents
which attended it; and might give the details of the favorable or
adverse circumstances which marked its progress.

Syn.
 -- Precedent; case; instance.
 -- Example, Instance. The discrimination to be made between these
two words relates to cases in which we give "instances" or "examples"
of things done. An instance denotes the single case then "standing"
before us; if there be others like it, the word does not express this
fact. On the contrary, an example is one of an entire class of like
things, and should be a true representative or sample of that class.
Hence, an example proves a rule or regular course of things; an
instance simply points out what may be true only in the case
presented. A man's life may be filled up with examples of the self-
command and kindness which marked his character, and may present only
a solitary instance of haste or severity. Hence, the word "example"
should never be used to describe what stands singly and alone. We do,
however, sometimes apply the word instance to what is really an
example, because we are not thinking of the latter under this aspect,
but solely as a case which "stands before us." See Precedent.

EXAMPLE
Ex*am"ple, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Exampled; p. pr. & vb. n. Exampling.]
