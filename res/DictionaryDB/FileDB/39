nucleoli, the whole being surrounded by a thin membrane, the cell
wall. In some cells, as in those of blood, in the amoeba, and in
embryonic cells (both vegetable and animal), there is no restricting
cell wall, while in some of the unicelluliar organisms the nucleus is
wholly wanting. See Illust. of Bipolar. Air cell. See Air cell.

(b) Having the radicle turned toward the sides of the fruit, as some
embryos. Centrifugal force (Mech.), a force whose direction is from a
center.

Note: When a body moves in a circle with uniform velocity, a force
must act on the body to keep it in the circle without change of
velocity. The direction of this force is towards the center of the
circle. If this force is applied by means of a string to the body,
the string will be in a state of tension. To a person holding the
other end of the string, this tension will appear to be directed
toward the body as if the body had a tendency to move away from the
center of the circle which it is describing. Hence this latter force
is often called centrifugal force. The force which really acts on the
body being directed towards the center of the circle is called
centripetal force, and in some popular treatises the centripetal and
centrifugal forces are described as opposing and balancing each
other. But they are merely the different aspects of the same stress.
