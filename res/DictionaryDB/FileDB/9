distance of time; belonging to times long past; specifically applied
to the times before the fall of the Roman empire; -- opposed to
modern; as, ancient authors, literature, history; ancient days.

Gildas Albanius . . . much ancienter than his namesake surnamed the
Wise. Fuller.

2. Old; that has been of long duration; of long standing; of great
age; as, an ancient forest; an ancient castle. "Our ancient
bickerings." Shak.

xxii. 28.

Syn.
 -- Old; primitive; pristine; antique; antiquated; old-fashioned;
obsolete.
 -- Ancient, Antiquated, Obsolete, Antique, Antic, Old.
 -- Ancient is opposed to modern, and has antiquity; as, an ancient
family, ancient landmarks, ancient institutions, systems of thought,
etc. Antiquated describes that which has gone out of use or fashion;
as, antiquated furniture, antiquated laws, rules, etc. Obsolete is
commonly used, instead of antiquated, in reference to language,
customs, etc.; as, an obsolete word or phrase, an obsolete
expression. Antique is applied, in present usage, either to that
which has come down from the ancients; as, an antique cameo, bust,
etc. ; or to that which is made to imitate some ancient work of art;
as, an antique temple. In the days of Shakespeare, antique was often
used for ancient; as, "an antique song," "an antique Roman;" and
hence, from singularity often attached to what is ancient, it was
used in the sense of grotesque; as, "an oak whose antique root peeps
out; " and hence came our present word antic, denoting grotesque or
ridiculous. We usually apply both ancient and old to things subject
to gradual decay. We say, an old man, an ancient record; but never,
the old stars, an old river or mountain. In general, however, ancient
is opposed to modern, and old to new, fresh, or recent. When we speak
of a thing that existed formerly, which has ceased to exist, we
commonly use ancient; as, ancient republics, ancient heroes; and not
old republics, old heroes. But when the thing which began or existed
in former times is still in existence, we use either ancient or old;
as, ancient statues or paintings, or old statues or paintings;
ancient authors, or old authors, meaning books.

Syn.
 -- Resentment; wrath; rage; fury; passion; ire gall; choler;
indignation; displeasure; vexation; grudge; spleen.
 -- Anger, Indignation, Resentment, Wrath, Ire, Rage, Fury. Anger is
a feeling of keen displeasure (usually with a desire to punish) for
what we regard as wrong toward ourselves or others. It may be
excessive or misplaced, but is not necessarily criminal. Indignation
is a generous outburst of anger in view of things which are indigna,
or unworthy to be done, involving what is mean, cruel, flagitious,
etc., in character or conduct. Resentment is often a moody feeling,
leading one to brood over his supposed personal wrongs with a deep
and lasting anger. See Resentment. Wrath and ire (the last poetical)
express the feelings of one who is bitterly provoked. Rage is a
vehement ebullition of anger; and fury is an excess of rage,
amounting almost to madness. Warmth of constitution often gives rise
to anger; a high sense of honor creates indignation at crime; a man
of quick sensibilities is apt to cherish resentment; the wrath and
ire of men are often connected with a haughty and vindictive spirit;
rage and fury are distempers of the soul to be regarded only with
abhorrence.
