1. The act of refracting, or the state of being refracted.

when it enters obliquely a medium of a different density from that

the perpendicular. Sir I. Newton.

3. (Astron.)
(a) The change in the direction of a ray of light, and, consequently,
in the apparent position of a heavenly body from which it emanates,
arising from its passage through the earth's atmosphere; -- hence
distinguished as atmospheric refraction, or astronomical refraction.
(b) The correction which is to be deducted from the apparent altitude
of a heavenly body on account of atmospheric refraction, in order to
obtain the true altitude. Angle of refraction (Opt.), the angle which
a refracted ray makes with the perpendicular to the surface
separating the two media traversed by the ray.
 -- Conical refraction (Opt.), the refraction of a ray of light into
an infinite number of rays, forming a hollow cone. This occurs when a
ray of light is passed through crystals of some substances, under
certain circumstances. Conical refraction is of two kinds; external
conical refraction, in which the ray issues from the crystal in the
form of a cone, the vertex of which is at the point of emergence; and
internal conical refraction, in which the ray is changed into the
form of a cone on entering the crystal, from which it issues in the
form of a hollow cylinder. This singular phenomenon was first
discovered by Sir W. R. Hamilton by mathematical reasoning alone,
unaided by experiment.
 -- Differential refraction (Astron.), the change of the apparent
place of one object relative to a second object near it, due to
refraction; also, the correction required to be made to the observed
relative places of the two bodies.
 -- Double refraction (Opt.), the refraction of light in two
directions, which produces two distinct images. The power of double
refraction is possessed by all crystals except those of the isometric
system. A uniaxial crystal is said to be optically positive (like
quartz), or optically negative (like calcite), or to have positive,
or negative, double refraction, according as the optic axis is the
axis of least or greatest elasticity for light; a biaxial crystal is
similarly designated when the same relation holds for the acute
bisectrix.
 -- Index of refraction. See under Index.
 -- Refraction circle (Opt.), an instrument provided with a graduated
circle for the measurement of refraction.
 -- Refraction of latitude, longitude, declination, right ascension,
etc., the change in the apparent latitude, longitude, etc., of a
heavenly body, due to the effect of atmospheric refraction.
 -- Terrestrial refraction, the change in the apparent altitude of a
distant point on or near the earth's surface, as the top of a
mountain, arising from the passage of light from it to the eye
through atmospheric strata of varying density.

Defn: Serving or having power to refract, or turn from a direct

for a ray passing out of one of the media into the other.
