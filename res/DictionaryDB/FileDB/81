the fact of direction in which involves polarity, or opposition of
properties in opposite directions; also, by attraction for many
substances, by a law involving attraction between surfaces of unlike
polarity, and repulsion between those of like; by exhibiting
accumulated polar tension when the circuit is broken; and by
producing heat, light, concussion, and often chemical changes when
the circuit passes between the poles or through any imperfectly
conducting substance or space. It is generally brought into action by
any disturbance of molecular equilibrium, whether from a chemical,
physical, or mechanical, cause.

electricity in the condition of a stationary charge, in which the
disturbance is produced by friction, as of glass, amber, etc., or by

chemical decomposition, as by means of a voltaic battery, or by
mechanical action, as by dynamo-electric machines. (c)

possibly with some chemical action). It is developed by uniting two
pieces of unlike metals in a bar, and then heating the bar unequally.
(d) Atmospheric electricity, any condition of electrical disturbance
in the atmosphere or clouds, due to some or all of the above
mentioned causes. (e) Magnetic electricity, electricity developed by
the action of magnets. (f) Positive electricity, the electricity that
appears at the positive pole or anode of a battery, or that is
produced by friction of glass; -- called also vitreous electricity.
(g) Negative electricity, the electricity that appears at the

ELEMENT
El"e*ment, n. Etym: [F. élément, L. elementum.]

1. One of the simplest or essential parts or principles of which
anything consists, or upon which the constitution or fundamental
powers of anything are based.

2. One of the ultimate, undecomposable constituents of any kind of
matter. Specifically: (Chem.) A substance which cannot be decomposed
into different kinds of matter by any means at present employed; as,
the elements of water are oxygen and hydrogen.

Note: The elements are naturally classified in several families or
groups, as the group of the alkaline elements, the halogen group, and
the like. They are roughly divided into two great classes, the
metals, as sodium, calcium, etc., which form basic compounds, and the
nonmetals or metalloids, as oxygen, sulphur, chlorine, which form
acid compounds; but the distinction is only relative, and some, as
arsenic, tin, aluminium, etc., form both acid and basic compounds.
The essential fact regarding every element is its relative atomic
weight or equivalent. When the elements are tabulated in the order of
their ascending atomic weights, the arrangement constitutes the
series of the Periodic law of Mendelejeff. See Periodic law, under
Periodic. This Periodic law enables us to predict the qualities of
unknown elements. The number of elements known is about seventy-five,
but the gaps in the Periodic law indicate the possibility of many
more. Many of the elements with which we are familiar, as hydrogen,
carbon, iron, gold, etc., have been recognized, by means of spectrum
analysis, in the sun and the fixed stars. From certain evidence (as
that afforded by the Periodic law, spectrum analysis, etc.) it
appears that the chemical elements probably may not be simple bodies,
but only very stable compounds of some simpler body or bodies. In
formulas, the elements are designated by abbreviations of their names
in Latin or New Latin.
