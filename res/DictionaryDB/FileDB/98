1. (Opt.)

Defn: A point in which the rays of light meet, after being reflected
or refrcted, and at which the image is formed; as, the focus of a
lens or mirror.

2. (Geom.)

Defn: A point so related to a conic section and certain straight line
called the directrix that the ratio of the distace between any point
of the curve and the focus to the distance of the same point from the
directrix is constant.

Note: Thus, in the ellipse FGHKLM, A is the focus and CD the
directrix, when the ratios FA:FE, GA:GD, MA:MC, etc., are all equal.
So in the hyperbola, A is the focus and CD the directrix when the
ratio HA:HK is constant for all points of the curve; and in the
parabola, A is the focus and CD the directrix when the ratio BA:BC is
constant. In the ellipse this ratio is less than unity, in the
parabola equal to unity, and in the hyperbola greater than unity. The
ellipse and hyperbola have each two foci, and two corresponding
directrixes, and the parabola has one focus and one directrix. In the
ellipse the sum of the two lines from any point of the curve to the
two foci is constant; that is: AG+GB=AH+HB; and in the hyperbola the
difference of the corresponding lines is constant. The diameter which
passes through the foci of the ellipse is the major axis. The
diameter which being produced passes through the foci of the
hyperbola is the transverse axis. The middle point of the major or
the transverse axis is the center of the curve. Certain other curves,
as the lemniscate and the Cartesian ovals, have points called foci,
possessing properties similar to those of the foci of conic sections.
In an ellipse, rays of light coming from one focus, and reflected
from the curve, proceed in lines directed toward the other; in an
hyperbola, in lines directed from the other; in a parabola, rays from
the focus, after reflection at the curve, proceed in lines parallel
to the axis. Thus rays from A in the ellipse are reflected to B; rays
from A in the hyperbola are reflected toward L and M away from B.

3. A central point; a point of concentration. Aplanatic focus. (Opt.)
See under Aplanatic.
 -- Conjugate focus (Opt.), the focus for rays which have a sensible
divergence, as from a near object; -- so called because the positions

effect.
 -- Principal, or Solar, focus (Opt.), the focus for parallel rays.

FOOD
Food, n. Etym: [OE. fode, AS. foda; akin to Icel. fæ\'eba, fæ\'ebi,
Sw. föda, Dan. & LG. föde, OHG. fatunga, Gr. patei^sthai to eat, and
perh. to Skr. pa to protect, L. pascere to feed, pasture, pabulum
food, E. pasture. *75. Cf. Feed, Fodder food, Foster to cherish.]

1. What is fed upon; that which goes to support life by being
received within, and assimilated by, the organism of an animal or a
plant; nutriment; aliment; especially, what is eaten by animals for
nourishment.

Note: In a physiological sense, true aliment is to be distinguished
as that portion of the food which is capable of being digested and
absorbed into the blood, thus furnishing nourishment, in distinction
from the indigestible matter which passes out through the alimentary
canal as fæces.

Note: Foods are divided into two main groups: nitrogenous, or
proteid, foods, i.e., those which contain nitrogen, and
nonnitrogenous, i.e., those which do not contain nitrogen. The latter
group embraces the fats and carbohydrates, which collectively are
sometimes termed heat producers or respiratory foods, since by
oxidation in the body they especially subserve the production of
heat. The proteids, on the other hand, are known as plastic foods or
tissue formers, since no tissue can be formed without them. These
latter terms, however, are misleading, since proteid foods may also
give rise to heat both directly and indirectly, and the fats and
carbohydrates are useful in other ways than in producing heat.

2. Anything that instructs the intellect, excites the feelings, or
molds habits of character; that which nourishes.
This may prove food to my displeasure. Shak.
In this moment there is life and food For future years. Wordsworth.
