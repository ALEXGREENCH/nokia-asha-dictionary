synthetically from ammonium cyanate, with which it is isomeric. Urea
ferment, a soluble ferment formed by certain bacteria, which,
however, yield the ferment from the body of their cells only after

yellow sediment, nearly always crystalline. Chemically, it is
composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, C5H4N4O3, and by

of light, answering to the mystic scarab in the pectoral plate of the
ancient Egyptian priests, and that the Thummim was an image
corresponding to that worn by the priestly judges of Egypt as a
symbol of truth and purity of motive. By gazing steadfastly on these,
he may have been thrown into a mysterious, half ecstatic state, akin
to hypnotism, in which he lost all personal consciousness, and
received a spiritual illumination and insight.

usage.

good usage and great liberty. Shak.

2. Manners; conduct; behavior. [Obs.]

courteous usage. Spenser.

3. Long-continued practice; customary mode of procedure; custom;
habitual use; method. Chaucer.
It has now been, during many years, the grave and decorous usage of
Parliaments to hear, in respectful silence, all expressions,

Macaulay.

4. Customary use or employment, as of a word or phrase in a
particular sense or signification.

5. Experience. [Obs.]
In eld [old age] is both wisdom and usage. Chaucer.

Syn.
 -- Custom; use; habit.
 -- Usage, Custom. These words, as here compared, agree in expressing
the idea of habitual practice; but a custom is not necessarily a
usage. A custom may belong to many, or to a single individual. A
usage properly belongs to the great body of a people. Hence, we speak
of usage, not of custom, as the law of language. Again, a custom is
merely that which has been often repeated, so as to have become, in a
good degree, established. A usage must be both often repeated and of
long standing. Hence, we speak of a "hew custom," but not of a "new
usage." Thus, also, the "customs of society" is not so strong an
expression as the "usages of society." "Custom, a greater power than
nature, seldom fails to make them worship." Locke. "Of things once
received and confirmed by use, long usage is a law sufficient."
Hooker. In law, the words usage and custom are often used
interchangeably, but the word custom also has a technical and
restricted sense. See Custom, n., 3.

7. The premium paid for the possession and employment of borrowed

8. Etym: [In this sense probably a corruption of OF. oes, fr. L. opus
need, business, employment, work. Cf. Operate.] (Law)

Defn: The benefit or profit of lands and tenements. Use imports a
trust and confidence reposed in a man for the holding of lands. He to
whose use or benefit the trust is intended shall enjoy the profits.

USE
Use, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Used; p. pr. & vb. n. Using.] Etym: [OE.
usen, F. user to use, use up, wear out, LL. usare to use, from L.
uti, p. p. usus, to use, OL. oeti, oesus; of uncertain origin. Cf.
Utility.]

1. To make use of; to convert to one's service; to avail one's self
of; to employ; to put a purpose; as, to use a plow; to use a chair;
to use time; to use flour for food; to use water for irrigation.

Syn.
 -- Employ.
 -- Use, Employ. We use a thing, or make use of it, when we derive
from it some enjoyment or service. We employ it when we turn that
service into a particular channel. We use words to express our
general meaning; we employ certain technical terms in reference to a
given subject. To make use of, implies passivity in the thing; as, to
make use of a pen; and hence there is often a material difference
between the two words when applied to persons. To speak of "making
use of another" generally implies a degrading idea, as if we had used
him as a tool; while employ has no such sense. A confidential friend
is employed to negotiate; an inferior agent is made use of on an
intrigue.
I would, my son, that thou wouldst use the power Which thy discretion
gives thee, to control And manage all. Cowper.
To study nature will thy time employ: Knowledge and innocence are
perfect joy. Dryden.

USE
Use, v. i.

1. To be wont or accustomed; to be in the habit or practice; as, he
used to ride daily; -- now disused in the present tense, perhaps
because of the similarity in sound, between "use to," and "used to."

Spenser.
Fears use to be represented in an imaginary. Bacon.
Thus we use to say, it is the room that smokes, when indeed it is the

Milton.

Syn.
 -- Fruitless; ineffectual.
 -- Useless, Fruitless, Ineffectual. We speak of an attempt, effort,
etc., as being useless when there are in it inherent difficulties
which forbid the hope of success, as fruitless when it fails, not
from any such difficulties, but from some unexpected hindrance
arising to frustrate it; as, the design was rendered fruitless by the
death of its projector. Ineffectual nearly resembles fruitless, but
implies a failure of a less hopeless character; as, after several
ineffectual efforts, I at last succeeded.
Useless are all words Till you have writ "performance" with your
swords. The other is for waiving. Beau. & Fl.
Waiving all searches into antiquity, in relation to this controversy,
as being either needless or fruitless. Waterland.
