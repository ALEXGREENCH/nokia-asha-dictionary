operation expressed by one symbol upon any quantity or any thing

y), fx, and fy indicate the results of any distributive operation
represented by the symbol f upon x + y, x, and y, severally, then
because of many very useful analogies f(x + y) is called the product
of f and x + y, and the operation indicated by f is called
multiplication. Cf. Facient, n., 2.
