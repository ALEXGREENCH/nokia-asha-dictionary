To- (, see To, prep.) Etym: [AS. to- asunder; akin to G. zer-, and
perhaps to L. dis-, or Gr.

Defn: An obsolete intensive prefix used in the formation of compound
verbs; as in to-beat, to-break, to-hew, to-rend, to-tear. See these
words in the Vocabulary. See the Note on All to, or All-to, under
All, adv.

TO
To (emphatic or alone, obscure or unemphatic), prep. Etym: [AS. to;
akin to OS. & OFries. to, D. toe, G. zu, OHG. zuo, zua, zo, Russ. do,
Ir. & Gael. do, OL. -do, -du, as in endo, indu, in, Gr. Too, Tatoo a
beat of drums.]

1. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival,
motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it,
access; and also, motion or tendency without arrival; movement
toward; -- opposed to Ant: from. "To Canterbury they wend." Chaucer.
Stay with us, go not to Wittenberg. Shak.
So to the sylvan lodge They came, that like Pomona's arbor smiled.
Milton.
I'll to him again, . . . He'll tell me all his purpose. She stretched
her arms to heaven. Dryden.

2. Hence, it indicates motion, course, or tendency toward a time, a
state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being regarded as
a limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going to a
trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.

Note: Formerly, by omission of the verb denoting motion, to sometimes
followed a form of be, with the sense of at, or in. "When the sun was
[gone or declined] to rest." Chaucer.

3. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of
application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or
indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs
with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges
upon that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or
appropriation; as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience;
let us keep this seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste;
an event painful to the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a
dislike to spirituous liquor.
Marks and points out each man of us to slaughter. B. Jonson.
Whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand
dumb and speak not to him. Shak.
Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge
temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
charity. 2 Pet. i. 5,6,7.
I have a king's oath to the contrary. Shak.
Numbers were crowded to death. Clarendon.
Fate and the dooming gods are deaf to tears. Dryden.
Go, buckle to the law. Dryden.

4. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last
defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it
as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to
go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do
my utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the
almost constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it
has no prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct
object or subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to
die for one's country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country.
Where the infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage
formerly allowed the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out
for see (Matt. xi. 8).
Then longen folk to go on pilgrimages, And palmers for to seeken
strange stranders. Chaucer.

Note: Such usage is now obsolete or illiterate. In colloquial usage,
to often stands for, and supplies, an infinitive already mentioned;
thus, he commands me to go with him, but I do not wish to.

5. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to has a
pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically. Thus, it denotes or
implies:
(a) Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as; as,
they met us to the number of three hundred.
We ready are to try our fortunes To the last man. Shak.
Few of the Esquimaux can count to ten. Quant. Rev.

(b) Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered to his
ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to the
prejudice of the state.
(c) Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as, they engaged
hand to hand.
Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face. 1 Cor.
xiii. 12.

(d) Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has a
husband to her mind.
He to God's image, she to his was made. Dryden.

(e) Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to twenty-seven; it
is ten to one that you will offend him.
All that they did was piety to this. B. Jonson.

(f) Addition; union; accumulation.
Wisdom he has, and to his wisdom, courage. Denham.

(g) Accompaniment; as, she sang to his guitar; they danced to the
music of a piano.
Anon they move In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood Of flutes and
soft recorders. Milton.

(h) Character; condition of being; purpose subserved or office
filled. [In this sense archaic] "I have a king here to my flatterer."
Shak.
Made his masters and others . . . to consider him to a little wonder.
Walton.

Note: To in to-day, to-night, and to-morrow has the sense or force of
for or on; for, or on, (this) day, for, or on, (this) night, for, or
on, (the) morrow. To-day, to-night, to-morrow may be considered as
compounds, and usually as adverbs; but they are sometimes used as
nouns; as, to-day is ours.
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow; Creeps in this petty pace
from day to day. Shak.
To and again, to and fro. [R.] -- To and fro, forward and back. In
this phrase, to is adverbial.
There was great showing both to and fro. Chaucer.
-- To-and-fro, a pacing backward and forward; as, to commence a to-
and-fro. Tennyson.
 -- To the face, in front of; in behind; hence, in the presence of.
 -- To wit, to know; namely. See Wit, v. i.

Note: To, without an object expressed, is used adverbially; as, put
to the door, i. e., put the door to its frame, close it; and in the
nautical expressions, to heave to, to come to, meaning to a certain
position. To, like on, is sometimes used as a command, forward, set
to. "To, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!" Shak.
