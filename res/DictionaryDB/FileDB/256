THAT
That, pron., a., conj., & adv. Etym: [AS. th\'91t, neuter nom. & acc.
sing. of the article (originally a demonstrative pronoun). The nom.
masc. se, and the nom. fem. seó are from a different root. AS.
th\'91t is akin to D. dat, G. das, OHG. daz, Sw. & Dan. det, Icel.
Þat (masc. sa, fem. so), Goth. Þata (masc. sa, fem. so), Gr. tat (for
tad, masc. sas, fem. sa); cf. L. istud that. *184. Cf. The, Their,
They, Them, This, Than, Since.]

1. As a demonstrative pronoun (pl. Those), that usually points out,
or refers to, a person or thing previously mentioned, or supposed to
be understood. That, as a demonstrative, may precede the noun to
which it refers; as, that which he has said is true; those in the
basket are good apples.
The early fame of Gratian was equal to that of the most celebrated
princes. Gibbon.

Note: That may refer to an entire sentence or paragraph, and not
merely to a word. It usually follows, but sometimes precedes, the
sentence referred to.

with the wicked. Gen. xviii. 25.
And when Moses heard that, he was content. Lev. x. 20.
I will know your business, Harry, that I will. Shak.

Note: That is often used in opposition to this, or by way of
distinction, and in such cases this, like the Latin hic and French
ceci, generally refers to that which is nearer, and that, like Latin
ille and French cela, to that which is more remote. When they refer
to foreign words or phrases, this generally refers to the latter, and
that to the former.
Two principles in human nature reign; Self-love, to urge, and Reason,
to restrain; Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call. Pope.
If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or that. James iv. 16.

2. As an adjective, that has the same demonstrative force as the
pronoun, but is followed by a noun.

judgment, than for that city. Matt. x. 15.
The woman was made whole from that hour. Matt. ix. 22.

Note: That was formerly sometimes used with the force of the article
the, especially in the phrases that one, that other, which were

Upon a day out riden knightes two . . . That one of them came home,
that other not. Chaucer.

3. As a relative pronoun, that is equivalent to who or which, serving
to point out, and make definite, a person or thing spoken of, or
alluded to, before, and may be either singular or plural.
He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame. Prov. ix. 7.
A judgment that is equal and impartial must incline to the greater
probabilities. Bp. Wilkins.

Note: If the relative clause simply conveys an additional idea, and
is not properly explanatory or restrictive, who or which (rarely
that) is employed; as, the king that (or who) rules well is generally
popular; Victoria, who (not that) rules well, enjoys the confidence
of her subjects. Ambiguity may in some cases be avoided in the use of
that (which is restrictive) instead of who or which, likely to be
understood in a coördinating sense. Bain. That was formerly used for
that which, as what is now; but such use is now archaic.
We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen. John iii.
11.
That I have done it is thyself to wite [blame]. Chaucer.
That, as a relative pronoun, cannot be governed by a preposition
preceding it, but may be governed by one at the end of the sentence
which it commences.
The ship that somebody was sailing in. Sir W. Scott.
In Old English, that was often used with the demonstratives he, his,
him, etc., and the two together had the force of a relative pronoun;
thus, that he = who; that his = whose; that him = whom.

him wirche [work]. Chaucer.
Formerly, that was used, where we now commonly use which, as a
relative pronoun with the demonstrative pronoun that as its
antecedent.
That that dieth, let it die; and that that is to cut off, let it be
cut off. Zech. xi. 9.

4. As a conjunction, that retains much of its force as a
demonstrative pronoun. It is used, specifically: --
(a) To introduce a clause employed as the object of the preceding
verb, or as the subject or predicate nominative of a verb.
She tells them 't is a causeless fantasy, And childish error, that
they are afraid. Shak.
I have shewed before, that a mere possibility to the contrary, can by
no means hinder a thing from being highly credible. Bp. Wilkins.

(b) To introduce, a reason or cause; -- equivalent to for that, in
that, for the reason that, because.
He does hear me; And that he does, I weep. Shak.

(c) To introduce a purpose; -- usually followed by may, or might, and
frequently preceded by so, in order, to the end, etc.
These things I say, that ye might be saved. John v. 34.
To the end that he may prolong his days. Deut. xvii. 20.

(d) To introduce a consequence, result, or effect; -- usually

conjunction on which it depends.

everything of that kind; all that sort.
