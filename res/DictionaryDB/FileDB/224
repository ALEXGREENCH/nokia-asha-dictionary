consciousness, whether agreeable or disagreeable, produced either by
an external object (stimulus), or by some change in the internal
state of the body.
Perception is only a special kind of knowledge, and sensation a
special kind of feeling. . . . Knowledge and feeling, perception and

Syn.
 -- Perception.
 -- Sensation, Perseption. The distinction between these words, when
used in mental philosophy, may be thus stated; if I simply smell a
rose, I have a sensation; if I refer that smell to the external
object which occasioned it, I have a perception. Thus, the former is
mere feeling, without the idea of an object; the latter is the mind's
apprehension of some external object as occasioning that feeling.
"Sensation properly expresses that change in the state of the mind
which is produced by an impression upon an organ of sense (of which
change we can conceive the mind to be conscious, without any
knowledge of external objects). Perception, on the other hand,
expresses the knowledge or the intimations we obtain by means of our
sensations concerning the qualities of matter, and consequently
involves, in every instance, the notion of externality, or outness,
which it is necessary to exclude in order to seize the precise import
of the word sensation." Fleming.

"The complement of those cognitions or convictions which we receive
from nature, which all men possess in common, and by which they test
the truth of knowledge and the morality of actions." (b) "The faculty
of first principles." These two are the philosophical significations.
(c) "Such ordinary complement of intelligence, that,if a person be
deficient therein, he is accounted mad or foolish." (d) When the
substantive is emphasized: "Native practical intelligence, natural
prudence, mother wit, tact in behavior, acuteness in the observation
of character, in contrast to habits of acquired learning or of
speculation." -- Moral sense. See under Moral, (a).
 -- The inner, or internal, sense, capacity of the mind to be aware
of its own states; consciousness; reflection. "This source of ideas
every man has wholly in himself, and though it be not sense, as
having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it,
and might properly enough be called internal sense." Locke.
 -- Sense capsule (Anat.), one of the cartilaginous or bony cavities
which inclose, more or less completely, the organs of smell, sight,
and hearing.
 -- Sense organ (Physiol.), a specially irritable mechanism by which
some one natural force or form of energy is enabled to excite sensory
nerves; as the eye, ear, an end bulb or tactile corpuscle, etc.
 -- Sense organule (Anat.), one of the modified epithelial cells in
or near which the fibers of the sensory nerves terminate.

Syn.
 -- Understanding; reason.
 -- Sense, Understanding, Reason. Some philosophers have given a
technical signification to these terms, which may here be stated.
Sense is the mind's acting in the direct cognition either of material
objects or of its own mental states. In the first case it is called
the outer, in the second the inner, sense. Understanding is the
logical faculty, i. e., the power of apprehending under general
conceptions, or the power of classifying, arranging, and making
deductions. Reason is the power of apprehending those first or
fundamental truths or principles which are the conditions of all real
and scientific knowledge, and which control the mind in all its
processes of investigation and deduction. These distinctions are
given, not as established, but simply because they often occur in
writers of the present day.

of some subject; feeling toward or respecting some person or thing;
disposition prompting to action or expression.
The word sentiment, agreeably to the use made of it by our best
English writers, expresses, in my own opinion very happily, those
complex determinations of the mind which result from the coöperation
of our rational powers and of our moral feelings. Stewart.
Alike to council or the assembly came, With equal souls and
sentiments the same. Pope.

Syn.
 -- Thought; opinion; notion; sensibility; feeling.
 -- Sentiment, Opinion, Feeling. An opinion is an intellectual
judgment in respect to any and every kind of truth. Feeling describes
those affections of pleasure and pain which spring from the exercise
of our sentient and emotional powers. Sentiment (particularly in the
plural) lies between them, denoting settled opinions or principles in
regard to subjects which interest the feelings strongly, and are
presented more or less constantly in practical life. Hence, it is
more appropriate to speak of our religious sentiments than opinions,
unless we mean to exclude all reference to our feelings. The word
sentiment, in the singular, leans ordinarily more to the side of
feeling, and denotes a refined sensibility on subjects affecting the
heart. "On questions of feeling, taste, observation, or report, we
define our sentiments. On questions of science, argument, or
metaphysical abstraction, we define our opinions. The sentiments of
the heart. The opinions of the mind . . . There is more of instinct
in sentiment, and more of definition in opinion. The admiration of a
work of art which results from first impressions is classed with our
sentiments; and, when we have accounted to ourselves for the
approbation, it is classed with our opinions." W. Taylor.

SENTIMENTAL
Sen`ti*men"tal, a. Etym: [Cf. F. sentimental.]

1. Having, expressing, or containing a sentiment or sentiments;
abounding with moral reflections; containing a moral reflection;
didactic. [Obsoles.]
Nay, ev'n each moral sentimental stroke, Where not the character, but
poet, spoke, He lopped, as foreign to his chaste design, Nor spared a
useless, though a golden line. Whitehead.

2. Inclined to sentiment; having an excess of sentiment or
sensibility; indulging the sensibilities for their own sake;
artificially or affectedly tender; -- often in a reproachful sense.
A sentimental mind is rather prone to overwrought feeling and
exaggerated tenderness. Whately.

3. Addressed or pleasing to the emotions only, usually to the weaker
and the unregulated emotions.

Syn.
 -- Romantic.
 -- Sentimental, Romantic. Sentimental usually describes an error or
excess of the sensibilities; romantic, a vice of the imagination. The
votary of the former gives indulgence to his sensibilities for the
mere luxury of their excitement; the votary of the latter allows his
imagination to rove for the pleasure of creating scenes of ideal
enjoiment. "Perhaps there is no less danger in works called
sentimental. They attack the heart more successfully, because more
cautiously." V. Knox. "I can not but look on an indifferency of mind,
as to the good or evil things of this life, as a mere romantic fancy
of such who would be thought to be much wiser than they ever were, or
could be." Bp. Stillingfleet.
