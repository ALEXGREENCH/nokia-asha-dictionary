 -- Savor; relish; flavor; sensibility; gout.
 -- Taste, Sensibility, Judgment. Some consider taste as a mere
sensibility, and others as a simple exercise of judgment; but a union
of both is requisite to the existence of anything which deserves the
name. An original sense of the beautiful is just as necessary to
æsthetic judgments, as a sense of right and wrong to the formation of
any just conclusions or moral subjects. But this "sense of the
beautiful" is not an arbitrary principle. It is under the guidance of
reason; it grows in delicacy and correctness with the progress of the
individual and of society at large; it has its laws, which are seated
in the nature of man; and it is in the development of these laws that
we find the true "standard of taste."
What, then, is taste, but those internal powers, Active and strong,
and feelingly alive To each fine impulse a discerning sense Of decent
and sublime, with quick disgust From things deformed, or disarranged,

state, nor culture, can bestow, But God alone, when first his active
hand Imprints the secret bias of the soul. Akenside.

TEA
Tea, n. Etym: [Chin. tsha, Prov. Chin. te: cf. F. thé.]

1. The prepared leaves of a shrub, or small tree (Thea, or Camellia,
Chinensis). The shrub is a native of China, but has been introduced
to some extent into some other countries.

Note: Teas are classed as green or black, according to their color or
appearance, the kinds being distinguished also by various other
characteristic differences, as of taste, odor, and the like. The
color, flavor, and quality are dependent upon the treatment which the
leaves receive after being gathered. The leaves for green tea are
heated, or roasted slightly, in shallow pans over a wood fire, almost
immediately after being gathered, after which they are rolled with
the hands upon a table, to free them from a portion of their
moisture, and to twist them, and are then quickly dried. Those
intended for black tea are spread out in the air for some time after
being gathered, and then tossed about with the hands until they
become soft and flaccid, when they are roasted for a few minutes, and
rolled, and having then been exposed to the air for a few hours in a
soft and moist state, are finally dried slowly over a charcoal fire.
The operation of roasting and rolling is sometimes repeated several
times, until the leaves have become of the proper color. The
principal sorts of green tea are Twankay, the poorest kind; Hyson
skin, the refuse of Hyson; Hyson, Imperial, and Gunpowder, fine
varieties; and Young Hyson, a choice kind made from young leaves
gathered early in the spring. Those of black tea are Bohea, the
poorest kind; Congou; Oolong; Souchong, one of the finest varieties;
and Pekoe, a fine-flavored kind, made chiefly from young spring buds.
See Bohea, Congou, Gunpowder tea, under Gunpowder, Hyson, Oolong, and
Souchong. K. Johnson. Tomlinson.

Note: "No knowledge of . . . [tea] appears to have reached Europe
till after the establishment of intercourse between Portugal and
China in 1517. The Portuguese, however, did little towards the
introduction of the herb into Europe, and it was not till the Dutch
established themselves at Bantam early in 17th century, that these
adventurers learned from the Chinese the habit of tea drinking, and
brought it to Europe." Encyc. Brit.

Syn.
 -- To vex; harass: annoy; disturb; irritate; plague; torment;

originally to seize and bear away hither and thither, and hence, to
disturb; as, to vex the ocean with storms. This sense of the term now
rarely occurs; but vex is still a stronger word than tease, denoting
the disturbance or anger created by minor provocations, losses,
disappointments, etc. We are teased by the buzzing of a fly in our
eyes; we are vexed by the carelessness or stupidity of our servants.

Defn: An apparatus, or a process, for communicating intelligence
rapidly between distant points, especially by means of preconcerted
visible or audible signals representing words or ideas, or by means
of words and signs, transmitted by electrical action.

Note: The instruments used are classed as indicator, type-printing,
symbol-printing, or chemical-printing telegraphs, according as the
intelligence is given by the movements of a pointer or indicator, as
in Cooke & Wheatstone's (the form commonly used in England), or by
impressing, on a fillet of paper, letters from types, as in House's
and Hughe's, or dots and marks from a sharp point moved by a magnet,
as in Morse's, or symbols produced by electro-chemical action, as in

is now little used, the receiving operator reading by ear the
combinations of long and short intervals of sound produced by the
armature of an electro-magnet as it is put in motion by the opening
and breaking of the circuit, which motion, in registering
instruments, traces upon a ribbon of paper the lines and dots used to
represent the letters of the alphabet. See Illustration in Appendix.

TELEPHONE
Tel"e*phone, n. Etym: [Gr. (Physics)

Defn: An instrument for reproducing sounds, especially articulate
speech, at a distance.

Note: The ordinary telephone consists essentially of a device by
which currents of electricity, produced by sounds through the agency
of certain mechanical devices and exactly corresponding in duration
and intensity to the vibrations of the air which attend them, are
transmitted to a distant station, and there, acting on suitable
mechanism, reproduce similar sounds by repeating the vibrations. The
necessary variations in the electrical currents are usually produced
by means of a microphone attached to a thin diaphragm upon which the
voice acts, and are intensified by means of an induction coil. In the
magnetic telephone, or magneto-telephone, the diaphragm is of soft
iron placed close to the pole of a magnet upon which is wound a coil
of fine wire, and its vibrations produce corresponding vibrable
currents in the wire by induction. The mechanical, or string,
telephone is a device in which the voice or sound causes vibrations
in a thin diaphragm, which are directly transmitted along a wire or
string connecting it to a similar diaphragm at the remote station,
thus reproducing the sound. It does not employ electricity.

TELESCOPE
Tel"e*scope, n. Etym: [Gr. télescope. See Telegraph, and -scope.]

Defn: An optical instrument used in viewing distant objects, as the

Note: A telescope assists the eye chiefly in two ways; first, by
enlarging the visual angle under which a distant object is seen, and
thus magnifying that object; and, secondly, by collecting, and
conveying to the eye, a larger beam of light than would enter the
naked organ, thus rendering objects distinct and visible which would
otherwise be indistinct and or invisible. Its essential parts are the
object glass, or concave mirror, which collects the beam of light,
and forms an image of the object, and the eyeglass, which is a
microscope, by which the image is magnified. Achromatic telescope.
See under Achromatic.
 -- Aplanatic telescope, a telescope having an aplanatic eyepiece.

Illust. under Reflecting telescope, below) is a Cassegrainian
telescope.
 -- Dialytic telescope. See under Dialytic. Equatorial telescope. See
the Note under Equatorial.
 -- Galilean telescope, a refracting telescope in which the eyeglass

natural positions.
 -- Gregorian telescope, a form of reflecting telescope. See under
Gregorian.
 -- Herschelian telescope, a reflecting telescope of the form
invented by Sir William Herschel, in which only one speculum is
employed, by means of which an image of the object is formed near one
side of the open end of the tube, and to this the eyeglass is applied
directly.
 -- Newtonian telescope, a form of reflecting telescope. See under
Newtonian.
 -- Photographic telescope, a telescope specially constructed to make
photographs of the heavenly bodies.
 -- Prism telescope. See Teinoscope.
 -- Reflecting telescope, a telescope in which the image is formed by
a speculum or mirror (or usually by two speculums, a large one at the
lower end of the telescope, and the smaller one near the open end)
instead of an object glass. See Gregorian, Cassegrainian,
Herschelian, and Newtonian, telescopes, above.
 -- Refracting telescope, a telescope in which the image is formed by
refraction through an object glass.
 -- Telescope carp (Zoöl.), the telescope fish.
 -- Telescope fish (Zoöl.), a monstrous variety of the goldfish
