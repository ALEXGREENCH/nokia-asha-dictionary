Defn: the eighth letter of the English alphabet, is classed among the

to form digraphs representing sounds which are not found in the
alphabet, as sh, th, th, as in shall, thing, thine (for zh see §274);
also, to modify the sounds of some other letters, as when placed
after c and p, with the former of which it represents a compound
sound like that of tsh, as in charm (written also tch as in catch),
with the latter, the sound of f, as in phase, phantom. In some words,
mostly derived or introduced from foreign languages, h following c
and g indicates that those consonants have the hard sound before e,
i, and y, as in chemistry, chiromancy, chyle, Ghent, Ghibelline,
etc.; in some others, ch has the sound of sh, as in chicane. See
Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 153, 179, 181-3, 237-8.

the same act. The two operate reciprocally on each other. The custom
of giving produces a habit of liberality; habits of devotion promote

will, selecting given modes of procedure; habit is a law of our
being, a kind of "second nature" which grows up within us.
