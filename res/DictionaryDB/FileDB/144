distributed, and form irregular spots or patches, usually of a
greenish or yellowish color, upon rocks, trees, and various bodies,
to which they adhere with great tenacity. They are often improperly
called rock moss or tree moss.

Note: A favorite modern theory of lichens (called after its inventor
the Schwendener hypothesis), is that they are not autonomous plants,
but that they consist of ascigerous fungi, parasitic on algæ. Each
lichen is composed of white filaments and green, or greenish, rounded
cells, and it is argued that the two are of different nature, the one
living at the expense of the other. See Hyphæ, and Gonidia.
