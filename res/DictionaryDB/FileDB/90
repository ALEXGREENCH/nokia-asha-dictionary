Note: The essential parts of the eye are inclosed in a tough outer
coat, the sclerotic, to which the muscles moving it are attached, and
which in front changes into the transparent cornea. A little way back
of cornea, the crystalline lens is suspended, dividing the eye into
two unequal cavities, a smaller one in front filled with a watery
fluid, the aqueous humor, and larger one behind filled with a clear
jelly, the vitreous humor. The sclerotic is lined with a highly
pigmented membrane, the choroid, and this is turn is lined in the
back half of the eyeball with the nearly transparent retina, in which
the fibers of the optic nerve ramify. The choroid in front is
continuous with the iris, which has a contractile opening in the
center, the pupil, admitting light to the lens which brings the rays
to a focus and forms an image upon the retina, where the light,
falling upon delicate structures called rods and cones, causes them
to stimulate the fibres of the optic nerve to transmit visual
impressions to the brain.
