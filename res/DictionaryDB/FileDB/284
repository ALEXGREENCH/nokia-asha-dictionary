WIT
Wit, n. Etym: [AS. witt, wit; akin to OFries. wit, G. witz, OHG.
wizzi, Icel. vit, Dan. vid, Sw. vett. sq. root133. See Wit, v.]

1. Mind; intellect; understanding; sense.
Who knew the wit of the Lord or who was his counselor Wyclif (Rom.
xi. 34).
A prince most prudent, of an excellent And unmatched wit and
judgment. Shak.
Will puts in practice what wit deviseth. Sir J. Davies.

2. A mental faculty, or power of the mind; -- used in this sense
chiefly in the plural, and in certain phrases; as, to lose one's
wits; at one's wits' end, and the like. "Men's wittes ben so dull."
Chaucer.
I will stare him out of his wits. Shak.

3. Felicitous association of objects not usually connected, so as to
produce a pleasant surprise; also. the power of readily combining
objects in such a manner.
The definition of wit is only this, that it is a propriety of
thoughts and words; or, in other terms, thoughts and words elegantly
adapted to the subject. Dryden.
Wit which discovers partial likeness hidden in general diversity.
Coleridge.
Wit lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together
with quickness and variety wherein can be found any resemblance or
congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures in the fancy. Locke.

4. A person of eminent sense or knowledge; a man of genius, fancy, or
humor; one distinguished for bright or amusing sayings, for repartee,
and the like.
In Athens, where books and wits were ever busier than in any other
part of Greece, I find but only two sorts of writings which the

But my five wits nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart
from serving thee. Shak.

Syn.
 -- Ingenuity; humor; satire; sarcasm; irony; burlesque.
 -- Wit, Humor. Wit primarily meant mind; and now denotes the power
of seizing on some thought or occurrence, and, by a sudden turn,
presenting it under aspects wholly new and unexpected -- apparently
natural and admissible, if not perfectly just, and bearing on the
subject, or the parties concerned, with a laughable keenness and
force. "What I want," said a pompous orator, aiming at his
antagonist, "is common sense." "Exactly!" was the whispered reply.
The pleasure we find in wit arises from the ingenuity of the turn,
the sudden surprise it brings, and the patness of its application to
the case, in the new and ludicrous relations thus flashed upon the
view. Humor is a quality more congenial to the English mind than wit.
It consists primarily in taking up the peculiarities of a humorist
(or eccentric person) and drawing them out, as Addison did those of
Sir Roger de Coverley, so that we enjoy a hearty, good-natured laugh
at his unconscious manifestation of whims and oddities. From this
original sense the term has been widened to embrace other sources of
kindly mirth of the same general character. In a well-known
caricature of English reserve, an Oxford student is represented as
standing on the brink of a river, greatly agitated at the sight of a
drowning man before him, and crying out, "O that I had been
introduced to this gentleman, that I might save his life! The,
"Silent Woman" of Ben Jonson is one of the most humorous productions,
in the original sense of the term, which we have in our language.
