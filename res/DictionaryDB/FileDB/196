Hamilton.

Note: In physical science, the properties of matter are distinguished
to the three following classes: 1. Physical properties, or those
which result from the relations of bodies to the physical agents,
light, heat, electricity, gravitation, cohesion, adhesion, etc., and
which are exhibited without a change in the composition or kind of
matter acted on. They are color, luster, opacity, transparency,
hardness, sonorousness, density, crystalline form, solubility,
capability of osmotic diffusion, vaporization, boiling, fusion, etc.
2. Chemical properties, or those which are conditioned by affinity
and composition; thus, combustion, explosion, and certain solutions
are reactions occasioned by chemical properties. Chemical properties
are identical when there is identity of composition and structure,
and change according as the composition changes. 3. Organoleptic
properties, or those forming a class which can not be included in
either of the other two divisions. They manifest themselves in the
contact of substances with the organs of taste, touch, and smell, or
otherwise affect the living organism, as in the manner of medicines
and poisons.

2. An acquired or artificial quality; that which is given by art, or
bestowed by man; as, the poem has the properties which constitute
excellence.

3. The exclusive right of possessing, enjoying, and disposing of a
thing; ownership; title.
Here I disclaim all my paternal care, Propinquity and property of
blood. Shak.
Shall man assume a property in man Wordsworth.

4. That to which a person has a legal title, whether in his
possession or not; thing owned; an estate, whether in lands, goods,

relation; ratio; as, the proportion of the parts of a building, or of

the fourth; -- called also geometrical proportion, in distinction
from arithmetical proportion, or that in which the difference of the

Note: Proportion in the mathematical sense differs from ratio. Ratio
is the relation of two quantities of the same kind, as the ratio of 5
to 10, or the ratio of 8 to 16. Proportion is the sameness or
likeness of two such relations. Thus, 5 to 10 as 8 to 16; that is, 5
bears the same relation to 10 as 8 does to 16. Hence, such numbers
are said to be in proportion. Proportion is expressed by symbols

together with the one sought, are proportional. Continued proportion,
Inverse proportion, etc. See under Continued, Inverse, etc.
 -- Harmonical, or Musical, proportion, a relation of three or four
quantities, such that the first is to the last as the difference
between the first two is to the difference between the last two;
thus, 2, 3, 6, are in harmonical proportion; for 2 is to 6 as 1 to 3.
Thus, 24, 16, 12, 9, are harmonical, for 24:9::8:3.
 -- In proportion, according as; to the degree that. "In proportion
as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and politically
