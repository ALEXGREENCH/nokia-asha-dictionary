Syn.
 -- To aid; assist; succor; relieve; serve; support; sustain;
befriend.
 -- To Help, Aid, Assist. These words all agree in the idea of
affording relief or support to a person under difficulties. Help
turns attention especially to the source of relief. If I fall into a
pit, I call for help; and he who helps me out does it by an act of
his own. Aid turns attention to the other side, and supposes
coöperation on the part of him who is relieved; as, he aided me in
getting out of the pit; I got out by the aid of a ladder which he
brought. Assist has a primary reference to relief afforded by a
person who "stands by" in order to relieve. It denotes both help and
aid. Thus, we say of a person who is weak, I assisted him upstairs,
or, he mounted the stairs by my assistance. When help is used as a
noun, it points less distinctively and exclusively to the source of
relief, or, in other words, agrees more closely with aid. Thus we
say, I got out of a pit by the help of my friend.
