Syn.
 -- Delusion, Illusion. These words both imply some deception
practiced upon the mind. Delusion is deception from want of
knowledge; illusion is deception from morbid imagination. An illusion
is a false show, a mere cheat on the fancy or senses. It is, in other
words, some idea or image presented to the bodily or mental vision
which does not exist in reality. A delusion is a false judgment,
usually affecting the real concerns of life. Or, in other words, it
is an erroneous view of something which exists indeed, but has by no
means the qualities or attributes ascribed to it. Thus we speak of
the illusions of fancy, the illusions of hope, illusive prospects,
illusive appearances, etc. In like manner, we speak of the delusions
of stockjobbing, the delusions of honorable men, delusive appearances
in trade, of being deluded by a seeming excellence. "A fanatic,
either religious or political, is the subject of strong delusions;
while the term illusion is applied solely to the visions of an
uncontrolled imagination, the chimerical ideas of one blinded by
hope, passion, or credulity, or lastly, to spectral and other ocular
deceptions, to which the word delusion is never applied." Whately.
