USURY
U"su*ry, n. Etym: [OE. usurie, usure, F. usure, L. usura use, usury,
interest, fr. uti, p. p. usus, to use. See Use, v. t.]

1. A premium or increase paid, or stipulated to be paid, for a loan,
as of money; interest. [Obs. or Archaic]
Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury
of victuals, usury of anything that is lent upon usury. Deut. xxiii.
19.
Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchanges, and

xxv. 27.

3. (Law)

Defn: Interest in excess of a legal rate charged to a borrower for
the use of money.

Note: The practice of requiring in repayment of money lent anything
more than the amount lent, was formerly thought to be a great moral
wrong, and the greater, the more was taken. Now it is not deemed more
wrong to take pay for the use of money than for the use of a house,
or a horse, or any other property. But the lingering influence of the
former opinion, together with the fact that the nature of money makes
it easier for the lender to oppress the borrower, has caused nearly
all Christian nations to fix by law the rate of compensation for the
use of money. Of late years, however, the opinion that money should
be borrowed and repaid, or bought and sold, upon whatever terms the
parties should agree to, like any other property, has gained ground
everywhere. Am. Cyc.

Syn.
 -- Usefulness; advantageous; benefit; profit; avail; service.

the concrete, while the latter is employed more in a general and
abstract sense. Thus, we speak of the utility of an invention, and
the usefulness of the thing invented; of the utility of an

a comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed
together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The
letter V is from the Latin alphabet, where it was used both as a
consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it
from it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel UPSILON (see Y), this
Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma
F (see F), or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they
took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u,
w, f, b, p; as in vine, wine; avoirdupois, habit, have; safe, save;
trover, troubadour, trope. See U, F, etc. See Guide to Pronunciation,

Va"lence, n. Etym: [From L. valens, -entis, p. pr. of valere to have
power, to be strong. See Valiant.] (Chem.)

Defn: The degree of combining power of an atom (or radical) as shown
by the number of atoms of hydrogen (or of other monads, as chlorine,
sodium, etc.) with which it will combine, or for which it can be
substituted, or with which it can be compared; thus, an atom of
hydrogen is a monad, and has a valence of one; the atoms of oxygen,
nitrogen, and carbon are respectively dyads, triads, and tetrads, and
have a valence respectively of two, three, and four.

Note: The valence of certain elements varies in different compounds.

the atomic weight, and is an essential factor in explaining the
chemical structures of compounds.

of which is ordinarily that of a liquid or solid.

one of kind as of degree, the latter being applied to all permanently
elastic fluids except atmospheric air, the former to those elastic
fluids which lose that condition at ordinary temperatures. The
atmosphere contains more or less vapor of water, a portion of which,
on a reduction of temperature, becomes condensed into liquid water in
the form of rain or dew. The vapor of water produced by boiling,
especially in its economic relations, is called steam.
Vapor is any substance in the gaseous condition at the maximum of
density consistent with that condition. This is the strict and proper
meaning of the word vapor. Nichol.

exactly to the required degree.
 -- Vapor burner, a burner for burning a vaporized hydrocarbon.

air. The vapor density of gases and vaporizable substances as

 -- Vapor engine, an engine worked by the expansive force of a vapor,
