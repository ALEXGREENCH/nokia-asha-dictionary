I do set my bow in the cloud. Gen. ix. 13.

Note: A classification of clouds according to their chief forms was
first proposed by the meteorologist Howard, and this is still
substantially employed. The following varieties and subvarieties are
recognized: (a) Cirrus. This is the most elevated of all the forms of
clouds; is thin, long-drawn, sometimes looking like carded wool or
hair, sometimes like a brush or room, sometimes in curl-like or
fleecelike patches. It is the cat's-tail of the sailor, and the
mare's-tail of the landsman. (b) Cumulus. This form appears in large
masses of a hemispherical form, or nearly so, above, but flat below,
one often piled above another, forming great clouds, common in the
summer, and presenting the appearance of gigantic mountains crowned
with snow. It often affords rain and thunder gusts. (c) Stratus. This
form appears in layers or bands extending horizontally. (d) Nimbus.
This form is characterized by its uniform gray tint and ragged edges;
it covers the sky in seasons of continued rain, as in easterly
storms, and is the proper rain cloud. The name is sometimes used to
denote a raining cumulus, or cumulostratus. (e) Cirro-cumulus. This
form consists, like the cirrus, of thin, broken, fleecelice clouds,
but the parts are more or less rounded and regulary grouped. It is
popularly called mackerel sky. (f) Cirro-stratus. In this form the
patches of cirrus coalesce in long strata, between cirrus and
stratus. (g) Cumulo-stratus. A form between cumulus and stratus,
often assuming at the horizon a black or bluish tint.
 -- Fog, cloud, motionless, or nearly so, lying near or in contact
with the earth's surface.
 -- Storm scud, cloud lying quite low, without form, and driven
rapidly with the wind.

2. A mass or volume of smoke, or flying dust, resembling vapor. "A
thick cloud of incense." Ezek. viii. 11.

3. A dark vein or spot on a lighter material, as in marble; hence, a
blemish or defect; as, a cloud upon one's reputation; a cloud on a
title.

4. That which has a dark, lowering, or threatening aspect; that which
temporarily overshadows, obscures, or depresses; as, a cloud of
sorrow; a cloud of war; a cloud upon the intellect.

5. A great crowd or multitude; a vast collection. "So great a cloud
of witnesses." Heb. xii. 1.

6. A large, loosely-knitted scarf, worn by women about the head.

superficial and capable of removal by release, decision in equity, or
