IMAGINATION
Im*ag`i*na"tion, n. Etym: [OE. imaginacionum, F. imagination, fr. L.
imaginatio. See Imagine.]

1. The imagine-making power of the mind; the power to create or
reproduce ideally an object of sense previously perceived; the power
to call up mental imagines.
Our simple apprehension of corporeal objects, if present, is sense;
if absent, is imagination. Glanvill.
Imagination is of three kinds: joined with belief of that which is to
come; joined with memory of that which is past; and of things
present, or as if they were present. Bacon.

2. The representative power; the power to reconstruct or recombine
the materials furnished by direct apprehension; the complex faculty
usually termed the plastic or creative power; the fancy.
The imagination of common language -- the productive imagination of
philosophers -- is nothing but the representative process plus the
process to which I would give the name of the "comparative." Sir W.
Hamilton.
The power of the mind to decompose its conceptions, and to recombine
the elements of them at its pleasure, is called its faculty of
imagination. I. Taylor.
The business of conception is to present us with an exact transcript
of what we have felt or perceived. But we have moreover a power of
modifying our conceptions, by combining the parts of different ones
together, so as to form new wholes of our creation. I shall employ
the word imagination to express this power. Stewart.

3. The power to recombine the materials furnished by experience or
memory, for the accomplishment of an elevated purpose; the power of
conceiving and expressing the ideal.
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet Are of imagination all compact .
. . The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven
to earth, from earth to heaven, And as imagination bodies forth The
forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes, and
gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name. Shak.

4. A mental image formed by the action of the imagination as a
faculty; a conception; a notion. Shak.

Syn.
 -- Conception; idea; conceit; fancy; device; origination; invention;
scheme; design; purpose; contrivance.
 -- Imagination, Fancy. These words have, to a great extent, been
interchanged by our best writers, and considered as strictly
synonymous. A distinction, however, is now made between them which
more fully exhibits their nature. Properly speaking, they are
different exercises of the same general power -- the plastic or
creative faculty. Imagination consists in taking parts of our
conceptions and combining them into new forms and images more select,
more striking, more delightful, more terrible, etc., than those of
ordinary nature. It is the higher exercise of the two. It creates by
laws more closely connected with the reason; it has strong emotion as
its actuating and formative cause; it aims at results of a definite
and weighty character. Milton's fiery lake, the debates of his
Pandemonium, the exquisite scenes of his Paradise, are all products
of the imagination. Fancy moves on a lighter wing; it is governed by
laws of association which are more remote, and sometimes arbitrary or
capricious. Hence the term fanciful, which exhibits fancy in its
wilder flights. It has for its actuating spirit feelings of a lively,
gay, and versatile character; it seeks to please by unexpected
combinations of thought, startling contrasts, flashes of brilliant
imagery, etc. Pope's Rape of the Lock is an exhibition of fancy which
has scarcely its equal in the literature of any country.
 -- "This, for instance, Wordworth did in respect of the words
`imagination' and `fancy.' Before he wrote, it was, I suppose,
obscurely felt by most that in `imagination' there was more of the
earnest, in `fancy' of the play of the spirit; that the first was a
loftier faculty and gift than the second; yet for all this words were
continually, and not without loss, confounded. He first, in the
preface to his Lyrical Ballads, rendered it henceforth impossible
that any one, who had read and mastered what he has written on the
two words, should remain unconscious any longer of the important
difference between them." Trench.
The same power, which we should call fancy if employed on a
production of a light nature, would be dignified with the title of
imagination if shown on a grander scale. C. J. Smith.
