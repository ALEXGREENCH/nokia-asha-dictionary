assigned, such expressions as x2, 3x, Log. x, and Sin. x, are all
functions of x. Algebraic function, a quantity whose connection with
the variable is expressed by an equation that involves only the
algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, raising to a given power, and extracting a given root; --

expansion.

(below).

continuity of its real values, as the variable changes between any
specified limits.
 -- Discontinuous function. See under Discontinuous.
 -- Elliptic functions, a large and important class of functions, so
called because one of the forms expresses the relation of the arc of
an ellipse to the straight lines connected therewith.
 -- Explicit function, a quantity directly expressed in terms of the
independently varying quantity; thus, in the equations y = 6x2, y =
10 -x3, the quantity y is an explicit function of x.
 -- Implicit function, a quantity whose relation to the variable is
expressed indirectly by an equation; thus, y in the equation x2 + y2
= 100 is an implicit function of x.
 -- Inverse trigonometrical functions, or Circular function, the
lengths of arcs relative to the sines, tangents, etc. Thus, AB is the
arc whose sine is BD, and (if the length of BD is x) is written sin -
1x, and so of the other lines. See Trigonometrical function (below).
Other transcendental functions are the exponential functions, the
elliptic functions, the gamma functions, the theta functions, etc.
 -- One-valued function, a quantity that has one, and only one, value
for each value of the variable.
 -- Transcendental functions, a quantity whose connection with the
variable cannot be expressed by algebraic operations; thus, y in the
equation y = 10x is a transcendental function of x. See Algebraic
function (above).
 -- Trigonometrical function, a quantity whose relation to the
variable is the same as that of a certain straight line drawn in a
circle whose radius is unity, to the length of a corresponding are of
the circle. Let AB be an arc in a circle, whose radius OA is unity
let AC be a quadrant, and let OC, DB, and AF be drawnpependicular to
OA, and EB and CG parallel to OA, and let OB be produced to G and F.
E Then BD is the sine of the arc AB; OD or EB is the cosine, AF is
the tangent, CG is the cotangent, OF is the secant OG is the
cosecant, AD is the versed sine, and CE is the coversed sine of the
are AB. If the length of AB be represented by x (OA being unity) then
the lengths of Functions. these lines (OA being unity) are the
trigonometrical functions of x, and are written sin x, cos x, tan x
(or tang x), cot x, sec x, cosec x, versin x, coversin x. These
quantities are also considered as functions of the angle BOA.
