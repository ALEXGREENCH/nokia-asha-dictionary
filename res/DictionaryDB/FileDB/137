righteousness and rectitude in all things; strict performance of
moral obligations; practical conformity to human or divine law;

 -- Chief justice. See in the Vocabulary.
 -- Justice of the peace (Law), a judicial officer or subordinate
magistrate appointed for the conservation of the peace in a specified

Syn.
 -- Equity; law; right; rectitude; honesty; integrity; uprightness;
fairness; impartiality.
 -- Justice, Equity, Law. Justice and equity are the same; but human
laws, though designed to secure justice, are of necessity imperfect,
and hence what is strictly legal is at times far from being equitable
or just. Here a court of equity comes in to redress the grievances.
It does so, as distinguished from courts of law; and as the latter
are often styled courts of justice, some have fancied that there is
in this case a conflict between justice and equity. The real conflict
is against the working of the law; this a court of equity brings into
accordance with the claims of justice. It would be an unfortunate use
of language which should lead any one to imagine he might have
justice on his side while practicing iniquity (inequity). Justice,
Rectitude. Rectitude, in its widest sense, is one of the most
comprehensive words in our language, denoting absolute conformity to
the rule of right in principle and practice. Justice refers more
especially to the carrying out of law, and has been considered by
moralists as of three kinds: (1) Commutative justice, which gives
every man his own property, including things pledged by promise. (2)
Distributive justice, which gives every man his exact deserts. (3)
General justice, which carries out all the ends of law, though not in
every case through the precise channels of commutative or
distributive justice; as we see often done by a parent or a ruler in
his dealings with those who are subject to his control.

check, deck, being necessary to exhibit a correct pronunciation in
the derivatives, cracked, checked, decked, cracking; since without
it, c, before the vowels e and i, would be sounded like s. Formerly,
