at the first view. Awkwardness is discovered only when a person
begins to move. Hence the expressions, a clumsy appearance, and an
awkward manner. When we speak figuratively of an awkward excuse, we
think of a want of ease and grace in making it; when we speak of a
clumsy excuse, we think of the whole thing as coarse and stupid. We
apply the term uncouth most frequently to that which results from the
want of instruction or training; as, uncouth manners; uncouth
language.

Defn: A tool or instrument of steel, or of iron with a steel edge or
blade, for felling trees, chopping and splitting wood, hewing timber,

carpenter's ax, is an ax for hewing timber, made heavier than the

Note: The word is used adjectively or in combination; as, axhead or

nearly every corresponding word of one syllable: as, flaxe, taxe,
waxe, sixe, mixe, pixe, oxe, fluxe, etc. This superfluous e is not
dropped; so that, in more than a hundred words ending in x, no one
thinks of retaining the e except in axe. Analogy requires its
exclusion here.

phonology, and analogy, than axe, which has of late become
prevalent." New English Dict. (Murray).
