from 312 a. d., but since the twelfth century it has been reckoned
from the birth of Christ. The papal indiction is the only one ever
used at the present day. To find the indiction and year of the
indiction by the first method, subtract 312 from the given year a.
d., and divide by 15; by the second method, add 3 to the given year
a. d., and the divide by 15. In either case, the quotient is the

charge of statical electricity develops a charge of statical
electricity of the opposite character in a neighboring body.
 -- Induction coil, an apparatus producing induced currents of great
intensity. It consists of a coil or helix of stout insulated copper
wire, surrounded by another coil of very fine insulated wire, in
which a momentary current is induced, when a current (as from a

 -- Philosophical induction, the inference, or the act of inferring,
that what has been observed or established in respect to a part,
individual, or species, may, on the ground of analogy, be affirmed or
received of the whole to which it belongs. This last is the inductive
method of Bacon. It ascends from the parts to the whole, and forms,
from the general analogy of nature, or special presumptions in the
case, conclusions which have greater or less degrees of force, and
which may be strengthened or weakened by subsequent experience and
experiment. It relates to actual existences, as in physical science
or the concerns of life. Logical induction is founded on the
necessary laws of thought; philosophical induction, on the
interpretation of the indications or analogy of nature.

Syn.
 -- Deduction.
 -- Induction, Deduction. In induction we observe a sufficient number
of individual facts, and, on the ground of analogy, extend what is
true of them to others of the same class, thus arriving at general
principles or laws. This is the kind of reasoning in physical
science. In deduction we begin with a general truth, which is already
proven or provisionally assumed, and seek to connect it with some
particular case by means of a middle term, or class of objects, known
to be equally connected with both. Thus, we bring down the general
into the particular, affirming of the latter the distinctive
qualities of the former. This is the syllogistic method. By induction
Franklin established the identity of lightning and electricity; by
deduction he inferred that dwellings might be protected by lightning
rods.

by mechanical power) gives out electrical energy as a generator.

INDUCTION MOTOR
