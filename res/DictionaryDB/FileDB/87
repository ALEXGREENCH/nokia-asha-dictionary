Es"ti*mate, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Estimated; p. pr. & vb. n.

t.]

1. To judge and form an opinion of the value of, from imperfect data,
-- either the extrinsic (money), or intrinsic (moral), value; to fix
the worth of roughly or in a general way; as, to estimate the value
of goods or land; to estimate the worth or talents of a person.
It is by the weight of silver, and not the name of the piece, that

data, comparison, or experience; to make an estimate of; to calculate
roughly; to rate; as, to estimate the cost of a trip, the number of
feet in a piece of land.

Syn.
 -- To appreciate; value; appraise; prize; rate; esteem; count;
calculate; number.
 -- To Estimate, Esteem. Both these words imply an exercise of the
judgment. Estimate has reference especially to the external relations
of things, such as amount, magnitude, importance, etc. It usually
involves computation or calculation; as, to estimate the loss or gain
of an enterprise. Esteem has reference to the intrinsic or moral
worth of a person or thing. Thus, we esteem a man for his kindness,
or his uniform integrity. In this sense it implies a mingled
sentiment of respect and attachment. We esteem it an honor to live in
a free country. See Appreciate.

ESTIMATE

J. C. Shairp.

Syn.
 -- Estimate, Estimation, Esteem. The noun estimate, like its verb,
supposes chiefly an exercise of judgment in determining the amount,
importance, or magnitude of things, with their other exterior
relations; as, an estimate of expenses incurred; a true estimate of
life, etc. Esteem is a moral sentiment made up of respect and
attachment, -- the valuation of a person as possessing useful
qualities or real worth. Thus we speak of the esteem of the wise and
good as a thing greatly to be desired. Estimation seems to waver
between the two. In our version of the Scriptures it is used simply
for estimate; as, "If he be poorer than thy estimation." Lev. xxvii.
8. In other cases, it verges toward esteem; as, "I know him to be of
worth and worthy estimation." Shak. It will probably settle down at
last on this latter sense. "Esteem is the value we place upon some
degree of worth. It is higher than simple approbation, which is a
decision of judgment. It is the commencement of affection." Gogan.
No; dear as freedom is, and in my heart's Just estimation prized
above all price. Cowper.
