INTERNAL-COMBUSTION; INTERNAL-COMBUSTION ENGINE
In*ter"nal-com*bus"tion, a. (Mach.)

Defn: Designating, or pertaining to, any engine (called an Internal-
combustion engine) in which the heat or pressure energy necessary to
produce motion is developed in the engine cylinder, as by the
explosion of a gas, and not in a separate chamber, as in a steam-
engine boiler. The gas used may be a fixed gas, or one derived from
alcohol, ether, gasoline (petrol), naphtha, oil (petroleum), etc.
There are three main classes: (1) gas engines proper, using fixed
gases, as coal, blast-furnace, or producer gas; (2) engines using the
vapor of a volatile fluid, as the typical gasoline (petrol) engine;
(3) oil engines, using either an atomized spray or the vapor
(produced by heat) of a comparatively heavy oil, as petroleum or
kerosene. In all of these the gas is mixed with a definite amount of
air, the charge is composed in the cylinder and is then exploded
either by a flame of gas (flame ignition -- now little used), by a
hot tube (tube ignition) or the like, by an electric spark (electric
ignition, the usual method is gasoline engines, or by the heat of
compression, as in the Diesel engine. Gas and oil engines are chiefly
of the stationary type. Gasoline engines are largely used for
automobile vehicles, boats, etc. Most internal-combustion engines use
the Otto (four-stroke) cycle, though many use the two-stroke cycle.
They are almost universally trunk engines and single-acting. Because
of the intense heat produced by the frequent explosions, the
cylinders must be cooled by a water jacket (water-cooled) or by air
currents (air cooled) to give the maximum thermodynamic efficiency
and to avoid excessive friction or seizing.
