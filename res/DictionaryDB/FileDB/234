from the first syllables of the first six lines of the following
stanza of a monkish hymn to St. John the Baptist. --
Ut queant laxis Resonare fibris Mira gestorum Famuli tuorum Solve
polluti Labii reatum, Sancte Joannes. Professor Skeat says the name
of the seventh note, si, was also formed by him [Guido] from the

gaseous) is absorbed into a liquid, and, remaining or becoming fluid,
is diffused throughout the solvent; also, the product reulting from

Note: When a solvent will not take in any more of a substance the
solution is said to be saturated. Solution is two kinds; viz.: (a)
Mechanical solution, in which no marked chemical change takes place,
and in which, in the case of solids, teh dissolved body can be
regained by evaporation, as in the solution of salt or sugar in
water. (b) Chemical solution, in which there is involved a decided
chemical change, as when limestone or zinc undergoes solution in
hydrochloric acid. Mechanical solution is regarded as a form of
molecular or atomic attraction, and is probably occasioned by the
formation of certain very weak and unstable compounds which are
easily dissociated and pass into new and similar compounds.

Note: This word is not used in chemistry or mineralogy for fusion, or
the melting of bodies by the heat of fire.

the like. Such solutions are much used in determining the specific
gravities of minerals, and in separating them when mechanically mixed
as in a pulverized rock.
 -- Nessler's solution. See Nesslerize.
 -- Solution of continuity, the separation of connection, or of
connected substances or parts; -- applied, in surgery, to a facture,
laceration, or the like. "As in the natural body a wound, or solution
of continuity, is worse than a corrupt humor, so in the spiritual."
Bacon.
 -- Standardized solution (Chem.), a solution which is used as a
reagent, and is of a known and standard strength; specifically, a
normal solution, containing in each cubic centimeter as many
