OXIDE
Ox"ide, n. Etym: [F. oxygène oxigen + acide acid: cf. F. oxyde. The

when, in ignorance or forgetfulness of the true history and
composition of the word, the orthography was change to make it
represent the u of Gr. 'oxy`s, from which it was supposed to be
directly derived.] (Chem.)

Defn: A binary compound of oxygen with an atom or radical, or a
compound which is regarded as binary; as, iron oxide, ethyl oxide,
nitrogen oxide, etc.

Note: In the chemical nomenclature adopted by Guyton de Morveau,
Lavoisier,and their associates, the term oxides was made to include
all compounds of oxygen which had no acid (F. acide) properties, as
contrasted with the acid, all of which were at that time supposed to

(Chem.)

Defn: To combine with oxygen, or subject to the action of oxygen, or
of an oxidizing agent. Specifically:
(a) To combine with oxygen or with more oxygen; to add oxygen to; as,
to oxidize nitrous acid so as to form nitric acid.
(b) To remove hydrogen from (anything), as by the action of oxygen;
as, to oxidize alcohol so as to form aldehyde.
(c) To subject to the action of oxygen or of an oxidizing agent, so
as to bring to a higher grade, as an -ous compound to an -ic
compound; as, to oxidize mercurous chloride to mercuric chloride.

Note: In certain cases to oxidize is identical with to acidify; for,
in nearly all cases, the more oxygen a substance contains the more
nearly does it approximate to acid qualities; thus, by oxidation many
elements, as sulphur, nitrogen, carbon, chromium, manganese, etc.,
pass into compounds which are acid anhydrides, and thus practically
in the acid state.

1. (Chem.)

Defn: A colorless, tasteless, odorless, gaseous element occurring in
the free state in the atmosphere, of which it forms about 23 per cent
by weight and about 21 per cent by volume, being slightly heavier
than nitrogen. Symbol O. Atomic weight 15.96.

Note: It occurs combined in immense quantities, forming eight ninths
by weight of water, and probably one half by weight of the entire
solid crust of the globe, being an ingredient of silica, the
silicates, sulphates, carbonates, nitrates, etc. Oxygen combines with
all elements (except fluorine), forming oxides, bases, oxyacid
anhydrides, etc., the process in general being called oxidation, of
which combustion is only an intense modification. At ordinary
temperatures with most substances it is moderately active, but at
higher temperatures it is one of the most violent and powerful
chemical agents known. It is indispensable in respiration, and in
general is the most universally active and efficient element. It may
be prepared in the pure state by heating potassium chlorate. This
element (called dephlogisticated air by Priestley) was named oxygen
by Lavoisier because he supposed it to be a constituent of all acids.
This is not so in the case of a very few acids (as hydrochloric,
hydrobromic, hydric sulphide, etc.), but these do contain elements
analogous to oxygen in property and action. Moreover, the fact that
most elements approach the nearer to acid qualities in proportion as
they are combined with more oxygen, shows the great accuracy and
breadth of Lavoisier's conception of its nature.
