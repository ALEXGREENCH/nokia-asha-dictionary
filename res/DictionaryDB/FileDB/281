What see'st thou in the ground Shak.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him Ps. viii. 4.
What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
Matt. viii. 27.

Note: Originally, what, when, where, which, who, why, etc., were
interrogatives only, and it is often difficult to determine whether
they are used as interrogatives or relatives. What in this sense,
when it refers to things, may be used either substantively or
adjectively; when it refers to persons, it is used only adjectively
with a noun expressed, who being the pronoun used substantively.

2. As an exclamatory word: -- (a) Used absolutely or independently; -
- often with a question following. "What welcome be thou." Chaucer.
What, could ye not watch with me one hour Matt. xxvi. 40.

(b) Used adjectively, meaning how remarkable, or how great; as, what
folly! what eloquence! what courage!

Note: In such phrases as I tell you what, what anticipates the
following statement, being elliptical for what I think, what it is,
how it is, etc. "I tell thee what, corporal Bardolph, I could tear
her." Shak. Here what relates to the last clause, "I could tear her;"
this is what I tell you. What not is often used at the close of an
enumeration of several particulars or articles, it being an
abbreviated clause, the verb of which, being either the same as that
of the principal clause or a general word, as be, say, mention,
enumerate, etc., is omitted. "Men hunt, hawk, and what not." Becon.
"Some dead puppy, or log, orwhat not." C. Kingsley. "Battles,
tournaments, hunts, and what not." De Quincey. Hence, the words are
often used in a general sense with the force of a substantive,
equivalent to anything you please, a miscellany, a variety, etc. From
this arises the name whatnot, applied to an étagère, as being a piece
of furniture intended for receiving miscellaneous articles of use or
ornament. But what is used for but that, usually after a negative,
and excludes everything contrary to the assertion in the following
sentence. "Her needle is not so absolutely perfect in tent and cross
stitch but what my superintendence is advisable." Sir W. Scott.

ho! an exclamation of calling.

that. "What though the rose have prickles, yet't is plucked." Shak.

limbs in those places, sometimes finishing by two or three blows on
the chest or stomach, which usually put an end to the life of the
criminal, and were hence called coups-de-grace -- blows of mercy. The
