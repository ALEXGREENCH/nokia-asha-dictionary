Chaucer.
And rest their weary limbs a tide. Spenser.
Which, at the appointed tide, Each one did make his bride. Spenser.
At the tide of Christ his birth. Fuller.

2. The alternate rising and falling of the waters of the ocean, and
of bays, rivers, etc., connected therewith. The tide ebbs and flows
twice in each lunar day, or the space of a little more than twenty-
four hours. It is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and moon
(the influence of the latter being three times that of the former),
acting unequally on the waters in different parts of the earth, thus
disturbing their equilibrium. A high tide upon one side of the earth
is accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. Hence, when the
sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition, as at new moon and
full moon, their action is such as to produce a greater than the
usual tide, called the spring tide, as represented in the cut. When
the moon is in the first or third quarter, the sun's attraction in
part counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction, thus producing
under the moon a smaller tide than usual, called the neap tide.

Note: The flow or rising of the water is called flood tide, and the
reflux, ebb tide.

3. A stream; current; flood; as, a tide of blood. "Let in the tide of
knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide." Shak.

leads on to fortune. Shak.

5. Violent confluence. [Obs.] Bacon.

of the atmosphere similar to those of the ocean, and produced in the

 -- Inferior tide. See under Inferior, a.
 -- To work double tides. See under Work, v. t.
 -- Tide day, the interval between the occurrences of two consecutive
maxima of the resultant wave at the same place. Its length varies as
the components of sun and moon waves approach to, or recede from, one
another. A retardation from this cause is called the lagging of the
tide, while the acceleration of the recurrence of high water is
termed the priming of the tide. See Lag of the tide, under 2d Lag.
 -- Tide dial, a dial to exhibit the state of the tides at any time.
 -- Tide gate. (a) An opening through which water may flow freely
