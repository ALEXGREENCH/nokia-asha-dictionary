or Spain or in the States which were once such colonies, esp. a

of Mexico.

Note: "The term creole negro is employed in the English West Indies
to distinguish the negroes born there from the Africans imported
during the time of the slave trade. The application of this term to
the colored people has led to an idea common in some parts of the
United States, though wholly unfounded, that it implies an admixture
greater or less of African blood." R. Hildreth.

Note: "The title [Creole] did not first belong to the descendants of
Spanish, but of French, settlers, But such a meaning implied a
certain excellence of origin, and so came early to include any native
of French or Spanish descent by either parent, whose nonalliance with
the slave race entitled him to social rank. Later, the term was
adopted by, not conceded to, the natives of mixed blood, and is still
so used among themselves. . . . Besides French and Spanish, there are
even, for convenience of speech, 'colored' Creoles; but there are no
Italian, or Sicilian, nor any English, Scotch, Irish, or 'Yankee'
Creoles, unless of parentage married into, and themselves thoroughly
proselyted in, Creole society." G. W. Cable.
