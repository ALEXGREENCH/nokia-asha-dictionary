Syn.
 -- To anticipate; look for; await; hope.
 -- To Expect, Think, Believe, Await. Expect is a mental act and has
aways a reference to the future, to some coming event; as a person
expects to die, or he expects to survive. Think and believe have
reference to the past and present, as well as to the future; as I
think the mail has arrived; I believe he came home yesterday, that he
is he is at home now. There is a not uncommon use of expect, which is
a confusion of the two; as, I expect the mail has arrived; I expect
he is at home. This misuse should be avoided. Await is a physical or
moral act. We await that which, when it comes, will affect us
personally. We expect what may, or may not, interest us personally.
