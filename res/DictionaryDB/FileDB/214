ROMAN CALENDAR
Roman calendar.

Defn: The calendar of the ancient Romans, from which our modern
calendars are derived. It is said to have consisted originally of ten
months, Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius, Quintilis, Sextilis,
September, October, November, and December, having a total of 304
days. Numa added two months, Januarius at the beginning of the year,
and Februarius at the end, making in all 355 days. He also ordered an
intercalary month, Mercedinus, to be inserted every second year.
Later the order of the months was changed so that January should come
before February. Through abuse of power by the pontiffs to whose care
it was committed, this calendar fell into confusion. It was replaced
by the Julian calendar. In designating the days of the month, the
Romans reckoned backward from three fixed points, the calends, the
nones, and the ides. The calends were always the first day of the
month. The ides fell on the 15th in March, May, July (Quintilis), and
October, and on the 13th in other months. The nones came on the
eighth day (the ninth, counting the ides) before the ides. Thus, Jan.
13 was called the ides of January, Jan. 12, the day before the ides,
and Jan. 11, the third day before the ides (since the ides count as
one), while Jan. 14 was the 19th day before the calends of February.
