Defn: One of a class of compounds, generally but not always

the power of destroying the distinctive properties of alkalies or

their own peculiar properties. They all contain hydrogen, united with
a more negative element or radical, either alone, or more generally

positive element or radical, a salt is formed, and hence acids are
