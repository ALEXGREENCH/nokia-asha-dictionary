O

1. O, the fifteenth letter of the English alphabet, derives its form,
value, and name from the Greek O, through the Latin. The letter came
into the Greek from the Phoenician, which possibly derived it
ultimately from the Egyptian. Etymologically, the letter o is most
closely related to a, e, and u; as in E. bone, AS. ban; E. stone, AS.
stan; E. broke, AS. brecan to break; E. bore, AS. beran to bear; E.
dove, AS. dufe; E. toft, tuft; tone, tune; number, F. nombre. The
letter o has several vowel sounds, the principal of which are its
long sound, as in bone, its short sound, as in nod, and the sounds
heard in the words orb, son, do (feod), and wolf (book). In
connection with the other vowels it forms several digraphs and
diphthongs. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 107-129.

2. Among the ancients, O was a mark of triple time, from the notion
that the ternary, or number 3, is the most perfect of numbers, and
properly expressed by a circle, the most perfect figure. O was also
anciently used to represent 11: with a dash over it (O
O, n.; pl. O's or Oes (.

1. The letter O, or its sound. "Mouthing out his hollow oes and aes."
Tennyson.

2. Something shaped like the letter O; a circle or oval. "This wooden
O [Globe Theater]". Shak.

3. A cipher; zero. [R.]
Thou art an O without a figure. Shak.

O
O, a. Etym: [See One.]

Defn: One. [Obs.] Chaucer. "Alle thre but o God." Piers Plowman.

O
O, interj.

Defn: An exclamation used in calling or directly addressing a person
or personified object; also, as an emotional or impassioned
exclamation expressing pain, grief, surprise, desire, fear, etc.
For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven. Ps. cxix. 89.
O how love I thy law ! it is my meditation all the day. Ps. cxix. 97.

Note: O is frequently followed by an ellipsis and that, an in
expressing a wish: "O [I wish] that Ishmael might live before thee !"
Gen. xvii. 18; or in expressions of surprise, indignation, or regret:
"O [it is sad] that such eyes should e'er meet other object !"
Sheridan Knowles.

Note: A distinction between the use of O and oh is insisted upon by
some, namely, that O should be used only in direct address to a
person or personified object, and should never be followed by the
exclamation point, while Oh (or oh) should be used in exclamations
where no direct appeal or address to an object is made, and may be
followed by the exclamation point or not, according to the nature or
construction of the sentence. Some insist that oh should be used only
as an interjection expressing strong feeling. The form O, however,
is, it seems, the one most commonly employed for both uses by modern
writers and correctors for the press. "O, I am slain !" Shak. "O what
a fair and ministering angel !" "O sweet angel !" Longfellow.
O for a kindling touch from that pure flame ! Wordsworth.
But she is in her grave, -- and oh The difference to me ! Wordsworth.
Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness ! Cowper.
We should distinguish between the sign of the vocative and the
emotional interjection, writing O for the former, and oh for the
latter. Earle.
O dear, and O dear me! Etym: [corrupted fr. F. O Dieu! or It. O Dio!
O God! O Dio mio! O my God! Wyman], exclamations expressive of
various emotions, but usually promoted by surprise, consternation,

OBJECTIVE
Ob*jec"tive, a. Etym: [Cf.F. objectif.]

1. Of or pertaining to an object.

2. (Metaph.)

Defn: Of or pertaining to an object; contained in, or having the
nature or position of, an object; outward; external; extrinsic; -- an
epithet applied to whatever ir exterior to the mind, or which is
simply an object of thought or feeling, and opposed to subjective.
In the Middle Ages, subject meant substance, and has this sense in
Descartes and Spinoza: sometimes, also, in Reid. Subjective is used
by William of Occam to denote that which exists independent of mind;
objective, what is formed by the mind. This shows what is meant by
realitas objectiva in Descartes. Kant and Fichte have inverted the
meanings. Subject, with them, is the mind which knows; object, that
which is known; subjective, the varying conditions of the knowing
mind; objective, that which is in the constant nature of the thing
known. Trendelenburg.
Objective means that which belongs to, or proceeds from, the object
known, and not from the subject knowing, and thus denotes what is
real, in opposition to that which is ideal -- what exists in nature,
in contrast to what exists merely in the thought of the individual.
Sir. W. Hamilton.
Objective has come to mean that which has independent exostence or
authority, apart from our experience or thought. Thus, moral law is
said to have objective authority, that is, authority belonging to
itself, and not drawn from anything in our nature. Calderwood
(Fleming's Vocabulary).

3. (Gram.)

Defn: Pertaining to, or designating, the case which follows a
transitive verb or a preposition, being that case in which the direct
object of the verb is placed. See Accusative, n.

Note: The objective case is frequently used without a governing word,
esp. in designations of time or space, where a preposition, as at,
in, on, etc., may be supplied.
My troublous dream [on] this night make me sad. Shak.
To write of victories [in or for] next year. Hudibras.
Objective line (Perspective), a line drawn on the geometrical plane
which is represented or sought to be represented.
 -- Objective plane (Perspective), any plane in the horizontal plane
that is represented.
 -- Objective point, the point or result to which the operations of
an army are directed. By extension, the point or purpose to which
anything, as a journey or an argument, is directed.

Syn.
 -- Objective, Subjective. Objective is applied to things exterior to
the mind, and objects of its attention; subjective, to the operations
of the mind itself. Hence, an objective motive is some outward thing
awakening desire; a subjective motive is some internal feeling or
propensity. Objective views are those governed by outward things;
subjective views are produced or modified by internal feeling. Sir
Walter Scott's poetry is chiefly objective; that of Wordsworth is
eminently subjective.
In the philosophy of mind, subjective denotes what is to be referred
to the thinking subject, the ego; objective what belongs to the
object of thought, the non-ego. Sir. W. Hamilton

Ob*tain", v. t. [imp. & p. p. Obtained; p. pr. & vb. n. Obtaining.]

1. To hold; to keep; to possess. [Obs.]

acquire, in any way.
Some pray for riches; riches they obtain. Dryden.
By guileful fair words peace may be obtained. Shak.
It may be that I may obtain children by her. Gen. xvi. 2.

Syn.
 -- To attain; gain; procure; acquire; win; earn. See Attain.
 -- To Obtain, Get, Gain, Earn, Acquire. The idea of getting is
common to all these terms. We may, indeed, with only a slight change
of sense, substitute get for either of them; as, to get or to gain a
prize; to get or to obtain an employment; to get or to earn a living;
to get or to acquire a language. To gain is to get by striving; and
as this is often a part of our good fortune, the word gain is
peculiarly applicable to whatever comes to us fortuitously. Thus, we
gain a victory, we gain a cause, we gain an advantage, etc. To earn
is to deserve by labor or service; as, to earn good wages; to earn a
triumph. Unfortunately, one does not always get or obtain what he has
earned. To obtain implies desire for possession, and some effort
directed to the attainment of that which is not immediately within
our reach. Whatever we thus seek and get, we obtain, whether by our
own exertions or those of others; whether by good or bad means;
whether permanently, or only for a time. Thus, a man obtains an
employment; he obtains an answer to a letter, etc. To acquire is more
limited and specific. We acquire what comes to us gradually in the
regular exercise of our abilities, while we obtain what comes in any
way, provided we desire it. Thus, we acquire knowledge, property,
honor, reputation, etc. What we acquire becomes, to a great extent,
permanently our own; as, to acquire a language; to acquire habits of
industry, etc.
