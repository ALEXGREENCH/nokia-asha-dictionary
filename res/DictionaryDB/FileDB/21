Note: In the trough battery, copper and zinc plates, connected in
pairs, divide the trough into cells, which are filled with an acid or
oxidizing liquid; the effect is exhibited when wires connected with
the two end-plates are brought together. In Daniell's battery, the
metals are zinc and copper, the former in dilute sulphuric acid, or a
solution of sulphate of zinc, the latter in a saturated solution of
sulphate of copper. A modification of this is the common gravity
battery, so called from the automatic action of the two fluids, which
are separated by their specific gravities. In Grove's battery,
platinum is the metal used with zinc; two fluids are used, one of
them in a porous cell surrounded by the other. In Bunsen's or the
carbon battery, the carbon of gas coke is substituted for the
platinum of Grove's. In Leclanché's battery, the elements are zinc in
a solution of ammonium chloride, and gas carbon surrounded with
manganese dioxide in a porous cell. A secondary battery is a battery
which usually has the two plates of the same kind, generally of lead,
in dilute sulphuric acid, and which, when traversed by an electric
current, becomes charged, and is then capable of giving a current of
itself for a time, owing to chemical changes produced by the charging
current. A storage battery is a kind of secondary battery used for
accumulating and storing the energy of electrical charges or
currents, usually by means of chemical work done by them; an
accumulator.

and is usually premeditated. A battle is commonly more general and
prolonged. An engagement supposes large numbers on each side, engaged

BAUME
Bau`mé", a.

Defn: Designating or conforming to either of the scales used by the
French chemist Antoine Baumé in the graduation of his hydrometers; of
or relating to Baumé's scales or hydrometers. There are two Baumé
hydrometers. One, which is used with liquids heavier than water,
sinks to 0º in pure water, and to 15º in a 15 per cent salt solution;
the other, for liquids lighter than water, sinks to 0º in a 10 per
cent salt solution and to 10º in pure water. In both cases the
graduation, based on the distance between these fundamental points,
is continued along the stem as far as desired. Since all the degrees
on a Baumé scale are thus equal in length, while those on a specific-
gravity scale grow smaller as the density increases, there is no
simple relation between degrees Bé. and Sp. gr. However, readings on
Baumés scale may be approximately reduced to specific gravities by
the following formulæ (x in each case being the reading on Baumé's
scale) : (a) for liquids heavier than water, sp. gr. = 144 ÷ (144 -
x);
 (b) for liquids lighter than water, sp. gr. = 144 ÷ (134 + x).

BE
Be, v. i. [imp. Was; p. p. Been; p. pr. & vb. n. Being.] Etym: [OE.
been, beon, AS. beón to be, beóm I am; akin to OHG. bim, pim, G. bin,
I am, Gael. & Ir. bu was, W. bod to be, Lith. bu-ti, O. Slav. by-ti,
to be, L. fu-i I have been, fu-turus about to be, fo-re to be about
to be, and perh to fieri to become, Gr. to be born, to be, Skr. bh to
be. This verb is defective, and the parts lacking are supplied by
verbs from other roots, is, was, which have no radical connection
with be. The various forms, am, are, is, was, were, etc., are
considered grammatically as parts of the verb "to be", which, with
its conjugational forms, is often called the substantive verb.
Future, Physic.]

1. To exist actually, or in the world of fact; to have ex
To be contents his natural desire. Pope.
To be, or not to be: that is the question. Shak.

2. To exist in a certain manner or relation, -- whether as a reality
or as a product of thought; to exist as the subject of a certain
predicate, that is, as having a certain attribute, or as belonging to
a certain sort, or as identical with what is specified, -- a word or
words for the predicate being annexed; as, to be happy; to be here;
to be large, or strong; to be an animal; to be a hero; to be a
nonentity; three and two are five; annihilation is the cessation of
existence; that is the man.

3. To take place; to happen; as, the meeting was on Thursday.

4. To signify; to represent or symbolize; to answer to.
The field is the world. Matt. xiii. 38.
The seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. Rev.
i. 20.

Note: The verb to be (including the forms is, was, etc.) is used in
forming the passive voice of other verbs; as, John has been struck by
James. It is also used with the past participle of many intransitive
verbs to express a state of the subject. But have is now more
commonly used as the auxiliary, though expressing a different sense;
as, "Ye have come too late -- but ye are come. " "The minstrel boy to
the war is gone." The present and imperfect tenses form, with the
infinitive, a particular future tense, which expresses necessity,
duty, or purpose; as, government is to be supported; we are to pay
our just debts; the deed is to be signed to-morrow.

Note: Have or had been, followed by to, implies movement. "I have
been to Paris." Sydney Smith. "Have you been to Franchard " R. L.
Stevenson.

Note: Been, or ben, was anciently the plural of the indicative
present. "Ye ben light of the world." Wyclif, Matt. v. 14. Afterwards
be was used, as in our Bible: "They that be with us are more than
they that be with them." 2 Kings vi. 16. Ben was also the old
infinitive: "To ben of such power." R. of Gloucester. Be is used as a
form of the present subjunctive: "But if it be a question of words
and names." Acts xviii. 15. But the indicative forms, is and are,
with if, are more commonly used. Be it so, a phrase of supposition,
equivalent to suppose it to be so; or of permission, signifying let
it be so. Shak.
 -- If so be, in case.
 -- To be from, to have come from; as, from what place are you I am
from Chicago.
 -- To let be, to omit, or leave untouched; to let alone. "Let be,
therefore, my vengeance to dissuade." Spenser.

Syn.
 -- To be, Exist. The verb to be, except in a few rare case, like
that of Shakespeare's "To be, or not to be", is used simply as a
copula, to connect a subject with its predicate; as, man is mortal;
the soul is immortal. The verb to exist is never properly used as a
mere copula, but points to things that stand forth, or have a
substantive being; as, when the soul is freed from all corporeal
alliance, then it truly exists. It is not, therefore, properly
synonymous with to be when used as a copula, though occasionally made
so by some writers for the sake of variety; as in the phrase "there
exists [is] no reason for laying new taxes." We may, indeed, say, "a
friendship has long existed between them," instead of saying, "there
has long been a friendship between them;" but in this case, exist is
not a mere copula. It is used in its appropriate sense to mark the
friendship as having been long in existence.

BE
Be*. Etym: [AS. be, and in accented form bi, akin to OS. be and bi,
OHG. bi, pi, and pi, MHG. be and bi, G. be and bei, Goth. bi, and
perh. Gr. about (cf. AS. beseón to look about). By, Amb-.]

Defn: A prefix, originally the same word as by; joined with verbs, it
serves: (a) To intensify the meaning; as, bespatter, bestir. (b) To
render an intransitive verb transitive; as, befall (to fall upon);
bespeak (to speak for). (c) To make the action of a verb particular
or definite; as, beget (to get as offspring); beset (to set around).

Note: It is joined with certain substantives, and a few adjectives,
to form verbs; as, bedew, befriend, benight, besot; belate (to make
late); belittle (to make little). It also occurs in certain nouns,
adverbs, and prepositions, often with something of the force of the
preposition by, or about; as, belief (believe), behalf, bequest
(bequeath); because, before, beneath, beside, between. In some words
the original force of be is obscured or lost; as, in become, begin,
behave, behoove, belong.
