consonants b, v, d, etc., and in the vowels; sonant, or intonated,
utterance; tone; -- distinguished from mere breath sound as heard in
f, s, sh, etc., and also whisper.

Note: Voice, in this sense, is produced by vibration of the so-called
vocal cords in the larynx (see Illust. of Larynx) which act upon the
air, not in the manner of the strings of a stringed instrument, but
as a pair of membranous tongues, or reeds, which, being continually
forced apart by the outgoing current of breath, and continually
brought together again by their own elasticity and muscular tension,
break the breath current into a series of puffs, or pulses,
sufficiently rapid to cause the sensation of tone. The power, or
loudness, of such a tone depends on the force of the separate pulses,
and this is determined by the pressure of the expired air, together
with the resistance on the part of the vocal cords which is
continually overcome. Its pitch depends on the number of aërial
pulses within a given time, that is, on the rapidity of their
succession. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 5, 146, 155.
