1. That which causes fermentation, as yeast, barm, or fermenting
beer.

Note: Ferments are of two kinds: (a) Formed or organized ferments.
(b) Unorganized or structureless ferments. The latter are also called
soluble or chemical ferments, and enzymes. Ferments of the first
class are as a rule simple microscopic vegetable organisms, and the
fermentations which they engender are due to their growth and
development; as, the acetic ferment, the butyric ferment, etc. See
Fermentation. Ferments of the second class, on the other hand, are
chemical substances, as a rule soluble in glycerin and precipitated
by alcohol. In action they are catalytic and, mainly, hydrolytic.
Good examples are pepsin of the dastric juice, ptyalin of the salvia,
and disease of malt. globular proteins, capable of catalyzing a wide
variety of chemical reactions, not merely hydrolytic. The full set of
enzymes causing production of ethyl alcohol from sugar has been
identified and individually purified and studied. See enzyme

Fer`men*ta"tion, n. Etym: [Cf. F. fermentation.]

1. The process of undergoing an effervescent change, as by the action
of yeast; in a wider sense (Physiol. Chem.), the transformation of an
organic substance into new compounds by the action of a ferment,
either formed or unorganized. It differs in kind according to the
nature of the ferment which causes it.

2. A state of agitation or excitement, as of the intellect or the
feelings.
It puts the soul to fermentation and activity. Jer. Taylor.
A univesal fermentation of human thought and faith. C. Kingsley.
Acetous, or Acetic, fermentation, a form of oxidation in which
alcohol is converted into vinegar or acetic acid by the agency of a
specific fungus or ferment (Mycoderma aceti). The process involves
two distinct reactions, in which the oxygen of the air is essential.
An intermediate product, aldehyde, is formed in the first process. 1.
C2H6O + O = H2O + C2H4O

Note: Alcohol. Water. Aldehyde. 2. C2H4O + O = C2H4O2

Note: Aldehyde. Acetic acid.
 -- Alcoholic fermentation, the fermentation which saccharine bodies
undergo when brought in contact with the yeast plant or Torula. The
sugar is converted, either directly or indirectly, into alcohol and
carbonic acid, the rate of action being dependent on the rapidity
with which the Torulæ develop.
 -- Ammoniacal fermentation, the conversion of the urea of the urine
into ammonium carbonate, through the growth of the special urea
ferment. CON2H4 + 2H2O = (NH4)2CO3

Note: Urea. Water. Ammonium carbonate.

Note: Whenever urine is exposed to the air in open vessels for
several days it undergoes this alkaline fermentation.
 -- Butyric fermentation, the decomposition of various forms of
organic matter, through the agency of a peculiar worm-shaped vibrio,
with formation of more or less butyric acid. It is one of the many
forms of fermentation that collectively constitute putrefaction. See
Lactic fermentation.
 -- Fermentation by an unorganized ferment or enzyme. Fermentations
of this class are purely chemical reactions, in which the ferment
acts as a simple catalytic agent. Of this nature are the
decomposition or inversion of cane sugar into levulose and dextrose
by boiling with dilute acids, the conversion of starch into dextrin
and sugar by similar treatment, the conversion of starch into like
products by the action of diastase of malt or ptyalin of saliva, the
conversion of albuminous food into peptones and other like products
by the action of pepsin-hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice or by
the ferment of the pancreatic juice.
 -- Fermentation theory of disease (Biol. & Med.), the theory that
most if not all, infectious or zymotic disease are caused by the
introduction into the organism of the living germs of ferments, or
ferments already developed (organized ferments), by which processes
of fermentation are set up injurious to health. See Germ theory.
 -- Glycerin fermentation, the fermentation which occurs on mixing a
dilute solution of glycerin with a peculiar species of schizomycetes
and some carbonate of lime, and other matter favorable to the growth
of the plant, the glycerin being changed into butyric acid, caproic
acid, butyl, and ethyl alcohol. With another form of bacterium
(Bacillus subtilis) ethyl alcohol and butyric acid are mainly formed.
 -- Lactic fermentation, the transformation of milk sugar or other
saccharine body into lactic acid, as in the souring of milk, through
the agency of a special bacterium (Bacterium lactis of Lister). In
this change the milk sugar, before assuming the form of lactic acid,
presumably passes through the stage of glucose. C12H22O11.H2O =
4C3H6O3

Note: Hydrated milk sugar. Lactic acid.

Note: In the lactic fermentation of dextrose or glucose, the lactic
acid which is formed is very prone to undergo butyric fermentation
after the manner indicated in the following equation: 2C3H6O3 (lactic
acid) = C4H8O2 (butyric acid) + 2CO2 (carbonic acid) + 2H2 (hydrogen
gas).
 -- Putrefactive fermentation. See Putrefaction.

FERMENTATION THEORY
Fer`men*ta"tion the"o*ry. (Med.)

Defn: The theory which likens the course of certain diseases (esp.
infectious diseases) to the process of fermentation, and attributes
them to the organized ferments in the body. It does not differ
materially from the accepted germ theory (which see).
