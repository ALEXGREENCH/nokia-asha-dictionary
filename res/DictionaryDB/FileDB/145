it down, and I laid it down. Lie is intransitive, and has for its
preterit lay; as, he told me to lie down, and I lay down. Some
persons blunder by using laid for the preterit of lie; as, he told me
to lie down, and I laid down. So persons often say incorrectly, the
ship laid at anchor; they laid by during the storm; the book was
laying on the shelf, etc. It is only necessary to remember, in all
such cases, that laid is the preterit of lay, and not of lie. To lie
along the shore (Naut.), to coast, keeping land in sight.

shine, Gr. ruc to shine. Lucid, Lunar, Luminous, Lynx.]

1. That agent, force, or action in nature by the operation of which
upon the organs of sight, objects are rendered visible or luminous.

Note: Light was regarded formerly as consisting of material
particles, or corpuscules, sent off in all directions from luminous
bodies, and traversing space, in right lines, with the known velocity
of about 186,300 miles per second; but it is now generally understood
to consist, not in any actual transmission of particles or substance,
but in the propagation of vibrations or undulations in a subtile,
elastic medium, or ether, assumed to pervade all space, and to be
thus set in vibratory motion by the action of luminous bodies, as the
atmosphere is by sonorous bodies. This view of the nature of light is
known as the undulatory or wave theory; the other, advocated by
Newton (but long since abandoned), as the corpuscular, emission, or
Newtonian theory. A more recent theory makes light to consist in
electrical oscillations, and is known as the electro-magnetic theory
of light.
