MHG. sifen, and L. sebum tallow. Cf. Saponaceous.]

Defn: A substance which dissolves in water, thus forming a lather,
and is used as a cleansing agent. Soap is produced by combining fats
or oils with alkalies or alkaline earths, usually by boiling, and
consists of salts of sodium, potassium, etc., with the fatty acids
(oleic, stearic, palmitic, etc.). See the Note below, and cf.
Saponification. By extension, any compound of similar composition or
properties, whether used as a cleaning agent or not.

Note: In general, soaps are of two classes, hard and soft. Calcium,
magnesium, lead, etc., form soaps, but they are insoluble and
useless.
The purifying action of soap depends upon the fact that it is
decomposed by a large quantity of water into free alkali and an
insoluble acid salt. The first of these takes away the fatty dirt on
washing, and the latter forms the soap lather which envelops the
greasy matter and thus tends to remove it. Roscoe & Schorlemmer.

olive oil and soda; -- called also Marseilles, or Venetian, soap.
 -- Hard soap, any one of a great variety of soaps, of different
