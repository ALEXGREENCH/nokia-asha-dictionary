than the secondary; as in as'pira''tion, where the chief stress is on
the third syllable, and a slighter stress on the first. Some words,

Note: In the ancient Greek the acute accent (') meant a raised tone
or pitch, the grave (`), the level tone or simply the negation of
accent, the circumflex ( ~ or ^) a tone raised and then depressed. In
works on elocution, the first is often used to denote the rising
inflection of the voice; the second, the falling inflection; and the
third (^), the compound or waving inflection. In dictionaries,
spelling books, and the like, the acute accent is used to designate
the syllable which receives the chief stress of voice.
