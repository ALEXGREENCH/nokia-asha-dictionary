and psychology, with which are connected logic and ethics; when it
treats of the necessary conceptions and relations by which philosophy
is possible, it is called metaphysics.

human, and the causes in which they are contained; -- the science of
effects by their causes; -- the science of sufficient reasons; -- the
science of things possible, inasmuch as they are possible; -- the
science of things evidently deduced from first principles; -- the
science of truths sensible and abstract; -- the application of reason
to its legitimate objects; -- the science of the relations of all
knowledge to the necessary ends of human reason; -- the science of
the original form of the ego, or mental self; -- the science of
science; -- the science of the absolute; -- the scienceof the
absolute indifference of the ideal and real." Sir W. Hamilton.

Pho`to*syn"the*sis, n. (Plant Physiol.)

Defn: The process of constructive metabolism by which carbohydrates
are formed from water vapor and the carbon dioxide of the air in the
chlorophyll-containing tissues of plants exposed to the action of
light. It was formerly called assimilation, but this is now commonly
used as in animal physiology. The details of the process are not yet
clearly known. Baeyer's theory is that the carbon dioxide is reduced
to carbon monoxide, which, uniting with the hydrogen of the water in
the cell, produces formaldehyde, the latter forming various sugars
through polymerization. Vines suggests that the carbohydrates are
secretion products of the chloroplasts, derived from decomposition of
previously formed proteids. The food substances are usually quickly
translocated, those that accumulate being changed to starch, which
appears in the cells almost simultaneously with the sugars. The
chloroplasts perform photosynthesis only in light and within a
certain range of temperature, varying according to climate. This is
the only way in which a plant is able to organize carbohydrates. All
plants without a chlorophyll apparatus, as the fungi, must be
parasitic or saprophytic. --Pho`to*syn*thet"ic (#), a. --
