Did Cæsar cross the Tiber He did not. "Do you love me" Shak. (d) Do,
as an auxiliary, is supposed to have been first used before
imperatives. It expresses entreaty or earnest request; as, do help
me. In the imperative mood, but not in the indicative, it may be used
with the verb to be; as, do be quiet. Do, did, and done often stand
as a general substitute or representative verb, and thus save the
repetition of the principal verb. "To live and die is all we have to
do." Denham. In the case of do and did as auxiliaries, the sense may
be completed by the infinitive (without to) of the verb represented.

Defn: A period of from four to six weeks, in the summer, variously
placed by almanac makers between the early part of July and the early
part of September; canicular days; -- so called in reference to the
rising in ancient times of the Dog Star (Sirius) with the sun.
Popularly, the sultry, close part of the summer.

Note: The conjunction of the rising of the Dog Star with the rising
of the sun was regarded by the ancients as one of the causes of the
sultry heat of summer, and of the maladies which then prevailed. But
as the conjunction does not occur at the same time in all latitudes,
and is not constant in the same region for a long period, there has
been much variation in calendars regarding the limits of the dog
days. The astronomer Roger Long states that in an ancient calendar in
Bede (died 735) the beginning of dog days is placed on the 14th of
July; that in a calendar prefixed to the Common Prayer, printed in
the time of Queen Elizabeth, they were said to begin on the 6th of
July and end on the 5th of September; that, from the Restoration
(1660) to the beginning of New Style (1752), British almanacs placed
the beginning on the 19th of July and the end on the 28th of August;
and that after 1752 the beginning was put on the 30th of July, the
end on the 7th of September. Some English calendars now put the
beginning on July 3d, and the ending on August 11th. A popular
American almanac of the present time (1890) places the beginning on
the 25th of July, and the end on the 5th of September.
