Syn.
 -- Pity; fellow-feeling; compassion; commiseration; tenderness;
condolence; agreement.
 -- Sympathy, Commiseration. Sympathy is literally a fellow-feeling
with others in their varied conditions of joy or of grief. This term,
however, is now more commonly applied to a fellow-feeling with others
under affliction, and then coincides very nearly with commiseration.
In this case it is commonly followed by for; as, to feel sympathy for
a friend when we see him distressed. The verb sympathize is followed
by with; as, to sympathize with a friend in his distresses or
enjoyments. "Every man would be a distinct species to himself, were
there no sympathy among individuals." South. See Pity.
