His reasoning was sufficiently profound. Macaulay.

Syn.
 -- Argumentation; argument.
 -- Reasoning, Argumentation. Few words are more interchanged than
these; and yet, technically, there is a difference between them.
Reasoning is the broader term, including both deduction and
induction. Argumentation denotes simply the former, and descends from
the whole to some included part; while reasoning embraces also the
latter, and ascends from a part to a whole. See Induction. Reasoning
is occupied with ideas and their relations; argumentation has to do
with the forms of logic. A thesis is set down: you attack, I defend
it; you insist, I prove; you distinguish, I destroy your
distinctions; my replies balance or overturn your objections. Such is
argumentation. It supposes that there are two sides, and that both
agree to the same rules. Reasoning, on the other hand, is often a
natural process, by which we form, from the general analogy of
nature, or special presumptions in the case, conclusions which have
greater or less degrees of force, and which may be strengthened or
weakened by subsequent experience.
