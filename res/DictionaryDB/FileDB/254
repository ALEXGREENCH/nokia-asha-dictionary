Syn.
 -- Rashness; precipitancy; heedlessness; venturesomeness.

term is more select and dignified; the Anglo-Saxon more familiar and
energetic. We show temerity in hasty decisions, and the conduct to
which they lead. We show rashness in particular actions, as dictated
by sudden impulse. It is an exhibition of temerity to approach the
verge of a precipice; it is an act of rashness to jump into a river
without being able to swim. Temerity, then, is an unreasonable
contempt of danger; rashness is a rushing into danger from
thoughtlessness or excited feeling.

almost all lands are held in fee simple, not of a superior, but the
whole right and title to the property being vested in the owner.

vacations. In the United States, the terms to be observed by the

of the several States.

6. (Logic)

Defn: The subject or the predicate of a proposition; one of the three
component parts of a syllogism, each one of which is used twice.
The subject and predicate of a proposition are, after Aristotle,
together called its terms or extremes. Sir W. Hamilton.

Note: The predicate of the conclusion is called the major term,
because it is the most general, and the subject of the conclusion is
called the minor term, because it is less general. These are called
the extermes; and the third term, introduced as a common measure
between them, is called the mean or middle term. Thus in the
following syllogism, --Every vegetable is combustible; Every tree is
a vegetable; Therefore every tree is combustible, -combustible, the
predicate of the conclusion, is the major term; tree is the minor
term; vegetable is the middle term.

7. A word or expression; specifically, one that has a precisely
limited meaning in certain relations and uses, or is peculiar to a
science, art, profession, or the like; as, a technical term. "Terms

Syn.
 -- Limit; bound; boundary; condition; stipulation; word; expression.
 -- Term, Word. These are more frequently interchanged than almost
any other vocables that occur of the language. There is, however, a
difference between them which is worthy of being kept in mind. Word
is generic; it denotes an utterance which represents or expresses our
thoughts and feelings. Term originally denoted one of the two
essential members of a proposition in logic, and hence signifies a
word of specific meaning, and applicable to a definite class of
objects. Thus, we may speak of a scientific or a technical term, and
of stating things in distinct terms. Thus we say, "the term minister
literally denotes servant;" "an exact definition of terms is
essential to clearness of thought;" "no term of reproach can
sufficiently express my indignation;" "every art has its peculiar and
distinctive terms," etc. So also we say, "purity of style depends on
the choice of words, and precision of style on a clear understanding
of the terms used." Term is chiefly applied to verbs, nouns, and
adjectives, these being capable of standing as terms in a logical
proposition; while prepositions and conjunctions, which can never be
so employed, are rarely spoken of as terms, but simply as words.
