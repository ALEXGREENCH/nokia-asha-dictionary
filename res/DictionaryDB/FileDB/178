between them, such as we often find between corresponding Anglo-Saxon
and Norman words. Forgive points to inward feeling, and suppose
alienated affection; when we ask forgiveness, we primarily seek the
removal of anger. Pardon looks more to outward things or
consequences, and is often applied to trifling matters, as when we
beg pardon for interrupting a man, or for jostling him in a crowd.

two words are, therefore, very clearly distinguished from each other
in most cases which relate to the common concerns of life.
