The ordeal by fire was performed, either by handling red-hot iron, or
by walking barefoot and blindfold over red-hot plowshares, laid at
unequal distances. If the person escaped unhurt, he was adjudged
innocent; otherwise he was condemned as guilty. The ordeal by water
was performed, either by plunging the bare arm to the elbow in
boiling water, an escape from injury being taken as proof of
innocence, or by casting the accused person, bound hand and foot,
into a river or pond, when if he floated it was an evidence of guilt,
but if he sunk he was acquitted. It is probable that the proverbial
phrase, to go through fire and water, denoting severe trial or
danger, is derived from the ordeal. See Wager of battle, under Wager.
