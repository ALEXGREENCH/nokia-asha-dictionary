Note: Local death is going on at times and in all parts of the living
body, in which individual cells and elements are being cast off and

kinds; death of the body as a whole (somatic or systemic death), and
death of the tissues. By the former is implied the absolute cessation
of the functions of the brain, the circulatory and the respiratory
organs; by the latter the entire disappearance of the vital actions
of the ultimate structural constituents of the body. When death takes
place, the body as a whole dies first, the death of the tissues
sometimes not occurring until after a considerable interval. Huxley.
