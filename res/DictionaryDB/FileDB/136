1. (R. C. Ch.)

Defn: One of a religious order founded by Ignatius Loyola, and
approved in 1540, under the title of The Society of Jesus.

Note: The order consists of Scholastics, the Professed, the Spiritual
Coadjutors, and the Temporal Coadjutors or Lay Brothers. The Jesuit
novice after two years becomes a Scholastic, and takes his first vows
of poverty, chastity, and obedience simply. Some years after, at the
close of a second novitiate, he takes his second vows and is ranked
among the Coadjutors or Professed. The Professed are bound by a
fourth vow, from which only the pope can dispense, requiring them to
go wherever the pope may send them for missionary duty. The
Coadjutors teach in the schools, and are employed in general
missionary labors. The Society is governed by a General who holds
office for life. He has associated with him "Assistants" (five at the
present time), representing different provinces. The Society was
first established in the United States in 1807. The Jesuits have
displayed in their enterprises a high degree of zeal, learning, and
skill, but, by their enemies, have been generally reputed to use art
and intrigue in promoting or accomplishing their purposes, whence the
words Jesuit, Jesuitical, and the like, have acquired an opprobrious
sense.

Defn: A lunisolar calendar in use among Hebraic peoples, reckoning
from the year 3761 b. c., the date traditionally given for the
Creation. It received its present fixed form from Hillel II. about
360 a. d. The present names of the months, which are Babylonian-
Assyrian in origin, replaced older ones, Abib, Bul, etc., at the time
of the Babylonian Exile. Nineteen years constitute a lunar cycle, of
which the 3d, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th years are leap
years. The year 5663 [1902-3 a. d.] was the first year of the 299th
lunar cycle. The common year is said to be defective, regular, or
perfect (or abundant) according as it has 353, 354, or 355 days. The
leap year has an intercalary month, and a total of 383 (defective),
384 (regular), or 385 (perfect, or abundant) days. The calendar is
complicated by various rules providing for the harmonious arrangement
of festivals, etc., so that no simple perpetual calendar can be
constructed. The following table gives the months in order, with the
number of days assigned to each. Only three months vary in length.
They are: Heshvan, which has 30 days in perfect years; Kislev, which
has 30 days in regular and perfect years; and Adar, which has 30 days
in leap years. The ecclesiastical year commences with Nisan and the
civil year with Tishri. The date of the first of Tishri, or the
Jewish New Year, is also given for the Jewish years 5661-5696 (1900-
1935 a. d.). From these tables it is possible to transform any Jewish
date into Christian, or vice versa, for the years 1900-1935 a. d.
