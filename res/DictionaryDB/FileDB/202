 -- Primitive; original; natural; underived; fundamental; entire.
 -- Radical, Entire. These words are frequently employed as
interchangeable in describing some marked alternation in the
condition of things. There is, however, an obvious difference between
them. A radical cure, reform, etc., is one which goes to the root of
the thing in question; and it is entire, in the sense that, by
affecting the root, it affects in a appropriate degree the entire
body nourished by the root; but it may not be entire in the sense of
making a change complete in its nature, as well as in its extent.
Hence, we speak of a radical change; a radical improvement; radical
differences of opinion; while an entire change, an entire
improvement, an entire difference of opinion, might indicate more
than was actually intended. A certain change may be both radical and
entire, in every sense.

and poetry. Cleland.

RADIUM
Ra`di*um, n. [NL., fr. L. radius ray.] (Chem.)

Defn: An intensely radioactive metallic element found (combined) in
minute quantities in pitchblende, and various other uranium minerals.
Symbol, Ra; atomic weight, 226.4. Radium was discovered by M. and
Mme. Curie, of Paris, who in 1902 separated compounds of it by a
tedious process from pitchblende. Its compounds color flames carmine
and give a characteristic spectrum. It resembles barium chemically.
Radium preparations are remarkable for maintaining themselves at a
higher temperature than their surroundings, and for their radiations,
which are of three kinds: alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays (see
these terms). By reason of these rays they ionize gases, affect
photographic plates, cause sores on the skin, and produce many other
striking effects. Their degree of activity depends on the proportion
of radium present, but not on its state of chemical combination or on
external conditions.The radioactivity of radium is therefore an
atomic property, and is explained as result from a disintegration of
the atom. This breaking up occurs in at least seven stages; the
successive main products have been studied and are called radium
emanation or exradio, radium A, radium B, radium C, etc. (The
emanation is a heavy gas, the later products are solids.) These
products are regarded as unstable elements, each with an atomic
weight a little lower than its predecessor. It is possible that lead
is the stable end product. At the same time the light gas helium is
formed; it probably consists of the expelled alpha particles. The
heat effect mentioned above is ascribed to the impacts of these
particles. Radium, in turn, is believed to be formed indirectly by an
immeasurably slow disintegration of uranium.
