We gentil women bee Loth to displease any wight, Notwithstanding our
great right. Chaucer's Dream.
Those on whom Christ bestowed miraculous cures were so transported
that their gratitude made them, notwithstanding his prohibition,
proclaim the wonders he had done. Dr. H. More.

Note: Notwithstanding was, by Johnson and Webster, viewed as a
participle absolute, an English equivalent of the Latin non obstante.
Its several meanings, either as preposition, adverb, or conjunction,
are capable of being explained in this view. Later grammarians, while
admitting that the word was originally a participle, and can be
treated as such, prefer to class it as a preposition or disjunctive
conjunction.

Syn.
 -- In spite of; despite.
 -- Notwithstanding, In spite of, Despite. These words and phrases
are often interchanged, but there is a difference between them,
chiefly in strength. Notwithstanding is the weaker term, and simply
points to some obstacle that may exist; as, I shall go,
notwithstanding the rain. In spite or despite of has reference
primarily to active opposition to be encountered from others; as,
"I'll be, in man's despite, a monarch; " "I'll keep mine own, despite
of all the world." Shak. Hence, these words, when applied to things,
suppose greater opposition than notwithstanding. We should say. "He
was thrust rudely out of doors in spite of his entreaties," rather
than "notwithstanding". On the other hand, it would be more civil to
say, "Notwithstanding all you have said, I must still differ with
you."

NOTWITHSTANDING
Not`with*stand"ing, adv. or conj. Etym: [Originally the participle of
withstand, with not prefixed.]

Defn: Nevertheless; however; although; as, I shall go,
notwithstanding it rains.
