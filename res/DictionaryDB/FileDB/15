of the will or feelings. We assent to the views of others when our
minds come to the same conclusion with theirs as to what is true,
right, or admissible. We consent when there is such a concurrence of
our will with their desires and wishes that we decide to comply with
their requests. The king of England gives his assent, not his
consent, to acts of Parliament, because, in theory at least, he is
not governed by personal feelings or choice, but by a deliberate,
judgment as to the common good. We also use assent in cases where a
proposal is made which involves but little interest or feeling. A
lady may assent to a gentleman's opening the window; but if he offers
himself in marriage, he must wait for her consent.
