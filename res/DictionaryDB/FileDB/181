previous to Reid, used in a very extensive signification. By

in a sense almost as unexclusive as consciousness, in its widest
signification. By Reid this word was limited to our faculty
acquisitive of knowledge, and to that branch of this faculty whereby,
through the senses, we obtain a knowledge of the external world. But
his limitation did not stop here. In the act of external perception
he distinguished two elements, to which he gave the names of
perception and sensation. He ought perhaps to have called these
perception proper and sensation proper, when employed in his special
meaning." Sir W. Hamilton.
