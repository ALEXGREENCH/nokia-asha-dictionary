AMICABLE
Am"i*ca*ble, a. Etym: [L. amicabilis, fr. amicus friend, fr. amare to
love. See Amiable.]

Defn: Friendly; proceeding from, or exhibiting, friendliness; after
the manner of friends; peaceable; as, an amicable disposition, or

parties referred to are not disposed to quarrel. Hence, we speak of
amicable relations between two countries, an amicable adjustment of
difficulties. "Those who entertain friendly feelings toward each
other can live amicably together."

But rather famish them amid their plenty. Shak.

Syn.
 -- Amidst, Among. These words differ to some extent from each other,
as will be seen from their etymology. Amidst denotes in the midst or
middle of, and hence surrounded by; as, this work was written amidst

distinct or separable objects; as, "He fell among thieves." "Blessed
art thou among women." Hence, we say, among the moderns, among the
ancients, among the thickest of trees, among these considerations,
among the reasons I have to offer. Amid and amidst are commonly used
when the idea of separate or distinguishable objects is not
prominent. Hence, we say, they kept on amidst the storm, amidst the
gloom, he was sinking amidst the waves, he persevered amidst many
difficulties; in none of which cases could among be used. In like
manner, Milton speaks of Abdiel, --
The seraph Abdiel, faithful found; Among the faithless faithful only
he, because he was then considered as one of the angels. But when the
poet adds, --
From amidst them forth he passed, we have rather the idea of the
angels as a collective body.
