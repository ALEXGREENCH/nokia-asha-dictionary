Skep"tic, n. Etym: [Gr. skeptiko`s thoughtful, reflective, fr.
ske`ptesqai to look carefully or about, to view, consider: cf. L.
scepticus, F. sceptique. See Scope.] [Written also sceptic.]

1. One who is yet undecided as to what is true; one who is looking or
inquiring for what is true; an inquirer after facts or reasons.

2. (Metaph.)

Defn: A doubter as to whether any fact or truth can be certainly
known; a universal doubter; a Pyrrhonist; hence, in modern usage,
occasionally, a person who questions whether any truth or fact can be
established on philosophical grounds; sometimes, a critical inquirer,
in opposition to a dogmatist.
All this criticism [of Hume] proceeds upon the erroneous hypothesis
that he was a dogmatist. He was a skeptic; that is, he accepted the
principles asserted by the prevailing dogmatism: and only showed that
such and such conclusions were, on these principles, inevitable. Sir
W. Hamilton.

3. (Theol.)

Defn: A person who doubts the existence and perfections of God, or
the truth of revelation; one who disbelieves the divine origin of the
Christian religion.
Suffer not your faith to be shaken by the sophistries of skeptics. S.
Clarke.

Note: This word and its derivatives are often written with c instead
of k in the first syllable, -- sceptic, sceptical, scepticism, etc.
Dr. Johnson, struck with the extraordinary irregularity of giving c
its hard sound before e, altered the spelling, and his example has
been followed by most of the lexicographers who have succeeded him;
yet the prevalent practice among English writers and printers is in
favor of the other mode. In the United States this practice is
reversed, a large and increasing majority of educated persons
preferring the orthography which is most in accordance with etymology
and analogy.

(especially in avoidance of danger or in escaping from a difficalty).
The same distinctions apply to the figurative sense of the words. A
man is skillful in any employment when he understands both its theory
and its practice. He is dexterous when he maneuvers with great
lightness. He is adroit in the use od quick, sudden, and well-
directed movements of the body or the mind, so as to effect the
object he has in view.
