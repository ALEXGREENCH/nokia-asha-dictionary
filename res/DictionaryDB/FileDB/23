Syn.
 -- Benevolence, Beneficence, Munificence. Benevolence marks a
disposition made up of a choice and desire for the happiness of
others. Beneficence marks the working of this disposition in
dispensing good on a somewhat broad scale. Munificence shows the same
disposition, but acting on a still broader scale, in conferring gifts
and favors. These are not necessarily confined to objects of
immediate utility. One may show his munificence in presents of
pictures or jewelry, but this would not be beneficence. Benevolence
of heart; beneficence of life; munificence in the encouragement of
letters.

BENEVOLENT
Be*nev"o*lent, a. Etym: [L. benevolens, -entis; bene well (adv. of
bonus good) + volens, p. pr. of volo I will, I wish. See Bounty, and
Voluntary.]

Defn: Having a disposition to do good; possessing or manifesting love
to mankind, and a desire to promote their prosperity and happiness;
disposed to give to good objects; kind; charitable.
 -- Be*nev"o*lent*ly, adv.

Syn.
 -- Benevolent, Beneficent. Etymologically considered, benevolent
implies wishing well to others, and beneficent, doing well. But by
degrees the word benevolent has been widened to include not only
feelings, but actions; thus, we speak of benevolent operations,
benevolent labors for the public good, benevolent societies. In like
manner, beneficent is now often applied to feelings; thus, we speak
of the beneficent intentions of a donor. This extension of the terms
enables us to mark nicer shades of meaning. Thus, the phrase
"benevolent labors" turns attention to the source of these labors,
viz., benevolent feeling; while beneficent would simply mark them as
productive of good. So, "beneficent intentions" point to the feelings
of the donor as bent upon some specific good act; while "benevolent
intentions" would only denote a general wish and design to do good.

Syn.
 -- Predilection; turn. Bent, Bias, Inclination, Prepossession. These
words agree in describing a permanent influence upon the mind which
tends to decide its actions. Bent denotes a fixed tendency of the
mind in a given direction. It is the widest of these terms, and
applies to the will, the intellect, and the affections, taken
conjointly; as, the whole bent of his character was toward evil
practices. Bias is literally a weight fixed on one side of a ball
used in bowling, and causing it to swerve from a straight course.
Used figuratively, bias applies particularly to the judgment, and
denotes something which acts with a permanent force on the character

etc. Inclination is an excited state of desire or appetency; as, a
strong inclination to the study of the law. Prepossession is a
mingled state of feeling and opinion in respect to some person or

inquiry. The word is commonly used in a good sense, an unfavorable
impression of this kind being denominated a prejudice. "Strong minds
will be strongly bent, and usually labor under a strong bias; but
there is no mind so weak and powerless as not to have its
inclinations, and none so guarded as to be without its
prepossessions." Crabb.

Syn.
 -- To beg; to crave.
 -- To Beseech, Entreat, Solicit, Implore, Supplicate. These words
agree in marking that sense of want which leads men to beg some
favor. To solicit is to make a request, with some degree of
earnestness and repetition, of one whom we address as a superior. To
entreat implies greater urgency, usually enforced by adducing reasons
or arguments. To beseech is still stronger, and belongs rather to the
language of poetry and imagination. To implore denotes increased
fervor of entreaty, as addressed either to equals or superiors. To
supplicate expresses the extreme of entreaty, and usually implies a
state of deep humiliation. Thus, a captive supplicates a conqueror to
spare his life. Men solicit by virtue of their interest with another;
they entreat in the use of reasoning and strong representations; they
beseech with importunate earnestness; they implore from a sense of
overwhelming distress; they supplicate with a feeling of the most
absolute inferiority and dependence.

 -- Beside, Besides. These words, whether used as prepositions or

make the following distinction between them: 1. That beside be used
only and always as a preposition, with the original meaning "by the
side of; " as, to sit beside a fountain; or with the closely allied
meaning "aside from", "apart from", or "out of"; as, this is beside
our present purpose; to be beside one's self with joy. The adverbial
sense to be wholly transferred to the cognate word. 2. That besides,
as a preposition, take the remaining sense "in addition to", as,
besides all this; besides the considerations here offered. "There was
a famine in the land besides the first famine." Gen. xxvi. 1. And
that it also take the adverbial sense of "moreover", "beyond", etc.,
which had been divided between the words; as, besides, there are
other considerations which belong to this case. The following
passages may serve to illustrate this use of the words: --
Lovely Thais sits beside thee. Dryden.

themselves with fear. Shak.
