Note: Walker condemns the pronunciation woond as a "capricious
novelty." It is certainly opposed to an important principle of our
language, namely, that the Old English long sound written ou, and
pronounced like French ou or modern English oo, has regularly
changed, when accented, into the diphthongal sound usually written
with the same letters ou in modern English, as in ground, hound,
round, sound. The use of ou in Old English to represent the sound of
modern English oo was borrowed from the French, and replaced the
older and Anglo-Saxon spelling with u. It makes no difference whether
the word was taken from the French or not, provided it is old enough
in English to have suffered this change to what is now the common
sound of ou; but words taken from the French at a later time, or
influenced by French, may have the French sound. Wound gall (Zoöl.),
an elongated swollen or tuberous gall on the branches of the
grapevine, caused by a small reddish brown weevil (Ampeloglypter

Defn: Act of one who wrestles; specif., the sport consisting of the
hand-to-hand combat between two unarmed contestants who seek to throw
each other. The various styles of wrestling differ in their
definition of a fall and in the governing rules. In Greco-Roman
wrestling, tripping and taking hold of the legs are forbidden, and a
fall is gained (that is, the bout is won), by the contestant who pins
both his opponent's shoulders to the ground. In catch-as-catch-can
wrestling, all holds are permitted except such as may be barred by
mutual consent, and a fall is defined as in Greco-Roman style.
Lancashire style wrestling is essentially the same as catch-as-catch-
can. In Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling the contestants stand
chest to chest, grasping each other around the body. The one first
losing his hold, or touching the ground with any part of his body
except his feet, loses the bout. If both fall to the ground at the
same time, it is a dogfall, and must be wrestled over. In the
Cornwall and Devon wrestling, the wrestlers complete in strong loose
linen jackets, catching hold of the jacket, or anywhere above the
waist. Two shoulders and one hip, or two hips and one shoulder, must
touch the ground to constitute a fall, and if a man is thrown
otherwise than on his back the contestants get upon their feet and
the bout recommences.
