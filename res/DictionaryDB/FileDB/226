definite limit; whereas a shadow represents in form the object which
intercepts the light. When we speak of the shade of a tree, we have
no reference to its form; but when we speak of measuring a pyramid or
other object by its shadow, we have reference to its form and extent.

SHALL
Shall, v. i. & auxiliary. [imp. Should.] Etym: [OE. shal, schal, imp.
sholde, scholde, AS. scal, sceal, I am obliged, imp. scolde, sceolde,
inf. sculan; akin to OS. skulan, pres. skal, imp. skolda, D. zullen,
pres. zal, imp. zoude, zou, OHG. solan, scolan, pres. scal, sol. imp.
scolta, solta, G. sollen, pres. soll, imp. sollte, Icel. skulu, pres.
skal, imp. skyldi, SW. skola, pres. skall, imp. skulle, Dan. skulle,
pres. skal, imp. skulde, Goth. skulan, pres. skal, imp. skulda, and
to AS. scyld guilt, G. schuld guilt, fault, debt, and perhaps to L.
scelus crime.]

Note: [Shall is defective, having no infinitive, imperative, or
participle.]

1. To owe; to be under obligation for. [Obs.] "By the faith I shall
to God" Court of Love.

2. To be obliged; must. [Obs.] "Me athinketh [I am sorry] that I
shall rehearse it her." Chaucer.

3. As an auxiliary, shall indicates a duty or necessity whose
obligation is derived from the person speaking; as, you shall go; he
shall go; that is, I order or promise your going. It thus ordinarily
expresses, in the second and third persons, a command, a threat, or a
promise. If the auxillary be emphasized, the command is made more
imperative, the promise or that more positive and sure. It is also
employed in the language of prophecy; as, "the day shall come when .
. . , " since a promise or threat and an authoritative prophecy
nearly coincide in significance. In shall with the first person, the
necessity of the action is sometimes implied as residing elsewhere
than in the speaker; as, I shall suffer; we shall see; and there is
always a less distinct and positive assertion of his volition than is
indicated by will. "I shall go" implies nearly a simple futurity;
more exactly, a foretelling or an expectation of my going, in which,
naturally enough, a certain degree of plan or intention may be
included; emphasize the shall, and the event is described as certain
to occur, and the expression approximates in meaning to our emphatic
"I will go." In a question, the relation of speaker and source of
obligation is of course transferred to the person addressed; as,
"Shall you go" (answer, "I shall go"); "Shall he go" i. e., "Do you
require or promise his going" (answer, "He shall go".) The same
relation is transferred to either second or third person in such
phrases as "You say, or think, you shall go;" "He says, or thinks, he
shall go." After a conditional conjunction (as if, whether) shall is
used in all persons to express futurity simply; as, if I, you, or he
shall say they are right. Should is everywhere used in the same
connection and the same senses as shall, as its imperfect. It also
expresses duty or moral obligation; as, he should do it whether he
will or not. In the early English, and hence in our English Bible,
shall is the auxiliary mainly used, in all the persons, to express
simple futurity. (Cf. Will, v. t.) Shall may be used elliptically;
thus, with an adverb or other word expressive of motion go may be
omitted. "He to England shall along with you." Shak.

Note: Shall and will are often confounded by inaccurate speakers and
writers. Say: I shall be glad to see you. Shall I do this Shall I
help you (not Will I do this) See Will.
