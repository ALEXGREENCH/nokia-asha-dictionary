ARMY ORGANIZATION
Army organization.

Defn: The system by which a country raises, classifies, arranges, and
equips its armed land forces. The usual divisions are: (1) A regular
or active army, in which soldiers serve continuously with the colors
and live in barracks or cantonments when not in the field; (2) the
reserves of this army, in which the soldiers, while remaining
constantly subject to a call to the colors, live at their homes,
being summoned more or less frequently to report for instruction,
drill, or maneuvers; and (3) one or more classes of soldiers
organized largely for territorial defense, living at home and having
only occasional periods of drill and instraction, who are variously
called home reserves (as in the table below), second, third, etc.,
line of defense (the regular army and its reserves ordinarily
constituting the first line of defense), territorial forces, or the
like. In countries where conscription prevails a soldier is supposed
to serve a given number of years.  He is usually enrolled first in
the regular army, then passes to its reserve, then into the home
reserves, to serve until he reaches the age limit. It for any reason
he is not enrolled in the regular army, he may begin his service in
the army reserves or even the home reserves, but then serves the full
number of years or up to the age limit. In equipment the organization
of the army is into the three great arms of infantry, cavalry, and
artillery, together with more or less numerous other branches, such
as engineers, medical corps, etc., besides the staff organizations
such as those of the pay and subsistence departments.
