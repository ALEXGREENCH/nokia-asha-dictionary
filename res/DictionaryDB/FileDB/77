Syn.
 -- To Draw, Drag. Draw differs from drag in this, that drag implies
a natural inaptitude for drawing, or positive resistance; it is
applied to things pulled or hauled along the ground, or moved with

that some kind of aptitude or provision exists for drawing. Draw is
the more general or generic term, and drag the more specific. We say,
the horses draw a coach or wagon, but they drag it through mire; yet
draw is properly used in both cases.
