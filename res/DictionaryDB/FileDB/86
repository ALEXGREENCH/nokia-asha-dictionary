Equity had been gradually shaping itself into a refined science which
no human faculties could master without long and intense application.
Macaulay.

Note: Equitable jurisprudence in England and in the United States
grew up from the inadequacy of common-law forms to secure justice in
all cases; and this led to distinct courts by which equity was
applied in the way of injunctions, bills of discovery, bills for
specified performance, and other processes by which the merits of a
case could be reached more summarily or more effectively than by
common-law suits. By the recent English Judicature Act (1873),
however, the English judges are bound to give effect, in common-law
suits, to all equitable rights and remedies; and when the rules of
equity and of common law, in any particular case, conflict, the rules
of equity are to prevail. In many jurisdictions in the United States,
equity and common law are thus blended; in others distinct equity
tribunals are still maintained. See Chancery. Equity of redemption
(Law), the advantage, allowed to a mortgageor, of a certain or
reasonable time to redeem lands mortgaged, after they have been
forfeited at law by the nonpayment of the sum of money due on the
mortgage at the appointed time. Blackstone.

Browne.

2. (Chem.)

Defn: That comparative quantity by weight of an element which
possesses the same chemical value as other elements, as determined by
actual experiment and reference to the same standard. Specifically:
(a) The comparative proportions by which one element replaces another
in any particular compound; thus, as zinc replaces hydrogen in
hydrochloric acid, their equivalents are 32.5 and 1. (b) The
combining proportion by weight of a substance, or the number
expressing this proportion, in any particular compound; as, the
equivalents of hydrogen and oxygen in water are respectively 1 and 8,
and in hydric dioxide 1 and 16.

Note: This term was adopted by Wollaston to avoid using the
conjectural expression atomic weight, with which, however, for a time
it was practically synonymous. The attempt to limit the term to the
meaning of a universally comparative combining weight failed, because
of the possibility of several compounds of the substances by reason
of the variation in combining power which most elements exhibit. The
equivalent was really identical with, or a multiple of submultiple
of, the atomic weight.

3. (Chem.)

Defn: A combining unit, whether an atom, a radical, or a molecule;
as, in acid salt two or more equivalents of acid unite with one or
more equivalents of base. Mechanical equivalent of heat (Physics),
the number of units of work which the unit of heat can perform; the
mechanical energy which must be expended to raise the temperature of
a unit weight of water from 0º C. to 1º C., or from 32º F. to 33º F.
The term was introduced by Dr. Mayer of Heilbronn. Its value was
found by Joule to be 1390 foot pounds upon the Centigrade, or 772
foot pounds upon the Fahrenheit, thermometric scale, whence it is
often called Joule's equivalent, and represented by the symbol J.
This is equal to 424 kilogram meters (Centigrade scale). A more
recent determination by Professor Rowland gives the value 426.9
kilogram meters, for the latitude of Baltimore.

Milton.

3. Uncertain, as an indication or sign; doubtful. "How equivocal a
test." Burke. Equivocal chord (Mus.), a chord which can be resolved
into several distinct keys; one whose intervals, being all minor
thirds, do not clearly indicate its fundamental tone or root; the
chord of the diminished triad, and the diminished seventh.

Syn.
 -- Ambiguous; doubtful; uncertain; indeterminate.
 -- Equivocal, Ambiguous. We call an expression ambiguous when it has
one general meaning, and yet contains certain words which may be
taken in two different senses; or certain clauses which can be so
connected with other clauses as to divide the mind between different
views of part of the meaning intended. We call an expression
equivocal when, taken as a whole, it conveys a given thought with
perfect clearness and propriety, and also another thought with equal
propriety and clearness. Such were the responses often given by the
Delphic oracle; as that to Crambiguous is a mere blunder of language;
what is equivocal is usually intended to deceive, though it may occur
at times from mere inadvertence. Equivocation is applied only to
cases where there is a design to deceive.

Equivocal, a.]

Defn: To use words of equivocal or doubtful signification; to express
