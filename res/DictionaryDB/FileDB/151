MALARIA PARASITE
Malaria parasite.

Defn: Any of several minute protozoans of the genus Plasmodium (syn.
Hæmatozoön) which in their adult condition live in the tissues of
mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles (which see) and when transferred to
the blood of man, by the bite of the mosquito, produce malaria. The
young parasites, or sporozoites, enter the red blood corpuscles,
growing at their expense, undergoing sporulation, and finally
destroying the corpuscles, thus liberating in the blood plasma an
immense number of small spores called merozoites. An indefinite but
not ultimated number of such generations may follow, but if meanwhile
the host is bitten by a mosquito, the parasites develop into gametes
in the stomach of the insect. These conjugate, the zygote thus
produced divides, forming spores, and eventually sporozoites, which,
penetrating to the salivary glands of the mosquito, may be introduced
into a new host. The attacks of the disease coincide with the
dissolution of the corpuscles and liberation of the spores and
products of growth of the parasites into the blood plasma. Several
species of the parasite are distinguished, as P. vivax, producing
tertian malaria; P. malariæ, quartan malaria; and P. (subgenus
Laverania) falciferum, the malarial fever of summer and autumn common
in the tropics.
