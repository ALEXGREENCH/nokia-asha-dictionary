PLANT
Plant, n. Etym: [AS. plante, L. planta.]

1. A vegetable; an organized living being, generally without feeling
and voluntary motion, and having, when complete, a root, stem, and
leaves, though consisting sometimes only of a single leafy expansion,
or a series of cellules, or even a single cellule.

Note: Plants are divided by their structure and methods of
reproduction into two series, phænogamous or flowering plants, which
have true flowers and seeds, and cryptogamous or flowerless plants,
which have no flowers, and reproduce by minute one-celled spores. In
both series are minute and simple forms and others of great size and
complexity. As to their mode of nutrition, plants may be considered
as self-supporting and dependent. Self-supporting plants always
contain chlorophyll, and subsist on air and moisture and the matter
dissolved in moisture, and as a general rule they excrete oxygen, and
use the carbonic acid to combine with water and form the material for
their tissues. Dependent plants comprise all fungi and many flowering
plants of a parasitic or saprophytic nature. As a rule, they have no
chlorophyll, and subsist mainly or wholly on matter already
organized, thus utilizing carbon compounds already existing, and not
excreting oxygen. But there are plants which are partly dependent and
partly self-supporting. The movements of climbing plants, of some
insectivorous plants, of leaves, stamens, or pistils in certain
plants, and the ciliary motion of zoöspores, etc., may be considered
a kind of voluntary motion.

plant of stubborn oak." Dryden.

1. The doctrines or philosophy by Plato or of his followers.

Note: Plato believed God to be an infinitely wise, just, and powerful
Spirit; and also that he formed the visible universe out of
preëxistent amorphous matter, according to perfect patterns of ideas
eternally existent in his own mind. Philosophy he considered as being
a knowledge of the true nature of things, as discoverable in those
eternal ideas after which all things were fashioned. In other words,
it is the knowledge of what is eternal, exists necessarily, and is
unchangeable; not of the temporary, the dependent, and changeable;
and of course it is not obtained through the senses; neither is it
the product of the understanding, which concerns itself only with the
variable and transitory; nor is it the result of experience and
observation; but it is the product of our reason, which, as partaking
of the divine nature, has innate ideas resembling the eternal ideas
of God. By contemplating these innate ideas, reasoning about them,
and comparing them with their copies in the visible universe, reason
can attain that true knowledge of things which is called philosophy.
Plato's professed followers, the Academics, and the New Platonists,
differed considerably from him, yet are called Platonists. Murdock.
