FAT
Fat, n.

1. (Physiol. Chem.)

Defn: An oily liquid or greasy substance making up the main bulk of
the adipose tissue of animals, and widely distributed in the seeds of
plants. See Adipose tissue, under Adipose.

Note: Animal fats are composed mainly of three distinct fats,
tristearin, tripalmitin, and triolein, mixed in varying proportions.
As olein is liquid at ordinary temperatures, while the other two fats
are solid, it follows that the consistency or hardness of fats
depends upon the relative proportion of the three individual fats.
During the life of an animal, the fat is mainly in a liquid state in
the fat cells, owing to the solubility of the two solid fats in the
more liquid olein at the body temperature. Chemically, fats are
composed of fatty acid, as stearic, palmitic, oleic, etc., united
with glyceryl. In butter fat, olein and palmitin predominate, mixed
with another fat characteristic of butter, butyrin. In the vegetable
kingdom many other fats or glycerides are to be found, as myristin
from nutmegs, a glyceride of lauric acid in the fat of the bay tree,
etc.

2. The best or richest productions; the best part; as, to live on the

acids.
