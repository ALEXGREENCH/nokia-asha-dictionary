4. (Giv. Law)
(a) A seizure or taking into custody by virtue of a legal process.
(b) The writ or percept commanding such seizure or taking.

Note: The term is applied to a seizure or taking either of persons or
property. In the serving of process in a civil suit, it is most
generally applied to the taking of property, whether at common law,
as a species of distress, to compel defendant's appearance, or under
local statutes, to satisfy the judgment the plaintiff may recover in
the action. The terms attachment and arrest are both applied to the
taking or apprehension of a defendant to compel an appearance in a
civil action. Attachments are issued at common law and in chancery,
against persons for contempt of court. In England, attachment is
employed in some cases where capias is with us, as against a witness
who fails to appear on summons. In some of the New England States a
writ of attachment is a species of mesne process upon which the
property of a defendant may be seized at the commencement of a suit
and before summons to him, and may be held to satisfy the judgment
the plaintiff may recover. In other States this writ can issue only
against absconding debtors and those who conceal themselves. See
Foreign, Garnishment, Trustee process. Bouvier. Burrill. Blackstone.

Syn.
 -- Attachment, Affection. The leading idea of affection is that of
warmth and tenderness; the leading idea of attachment is that of
being bound to some object by strong and lasting ties. There is more
of sentiment (and sometimes of romance) in affection, and more of
principle in preserving attachment. We speak of the ardor of the one,
and the fidelity of the other. There is another distinction in the
use and application of these words. The term attachment is applied to
a wider range of objects than affection. A man may have a strong
attachment to his country, to his profession, to his principles, and
even to favorite places; in respect to none of these could we use the
word affection.

ATTACK
At*tack", v. t. [imp. & p. p. Attacked; p. pr. & vb. n. Attacking.]

destructively; to begin to decompose or waste.

Hydrofluoric acid . . . attacks the glass. B. Stewart.

Syn.
 -- To Attack, Assail, Assault, Invade. These words all denote a
violent onset; attack being the generic term, and the others specific
forms of attack. To attack is to commence the onset; to assail is to
make a sudden and violent attack, or to make repeated attacks; to
assault (literally, to leap upon) is to attack physically by a had-
to-hand approach or by unlawful and insulting violence; to invade is
to enter by force on what belongs to another. Thus, a person may
attack by offering violence of any kind; he may assail by means of
missile weapons; he may assault by direct personal violence; a king
may invade by marching an army into a country. Figuratively, we may
say, men attack with argument or satire; they assail with abuse or
reproaches; they may be assaulted by severe temptations; the rights
of the people may be invaded by the encroachments of the crown.

which do not necessarily imply such effort or motion. We procure or
obtain a thing by purchase or loan, and we obtain by inheritance, but
we do not attain it by such means.

1. The act of attainting, or the state of being attainted; the
extinction of the civil rights and capacities of a person, consequent
upon sentence of death or outlawry; as, an act of attainder. Abbott.

Note: Formerly attainder was the inseparable consequence of a
judicial or legislative sentence for treason or felony, and involved
the forfeiture of all the real and personal property of the condemned
person, and such "corruption of blood" that he could neither receive
nor transmit by inheritance, nor could he sue or testify in any
court, or claim any legal protection or rights. In England attainders
are now abolished, and in the United States the Constitution provides
that no bill of attainder shall be passed; and no attainder of
treason (in consequence of a judicial sentence) shall work corruption
of blood or forfeiture, except during the life of the person
attainted.

2. A stain or staining; state of being in dishonor or condemnation.
[Obs.]
He lived from all attainder of suspect. Shak.

Syn.
 -- Attitude, Posture. Both of these words describe the visible
disposition of the limbs. Posture relates to their position merely;
attitude refers to their fitness for some specific object. The object
of an attitude is to set forth exhibit some internal feeling; as,
attitude of wonder, of admiration, of grief, etc. It is, therefore,
essentially and designedly expressive. Its object is the same with
that of gesture; viz., to hold forth and represent. Posture has no
such design. If we speak of posture in prayer, or the posture of
devotion, it is only the natural disposition of the limbs, without
any intention to show forth or exhibit.
'T is business of a painter in his choice of attitudes (posituræ) to
foresee the effect and harmony of the lights and shadows. Dryden.

Note: An attorney is either public or private. A private attorney, or
an attorney in fact, is a person appointed by another, by a letter or
power of attorney, to transact any business for him out of court; but
in a more extended sense, this class includes any agent employed in
any business, or to do any act in pais, for another. A public
attorney, or attorney at law, is a practitioner in a court of law,
legally qualified to prosecute and defend actions in such court, on
the retainer of clients. Bouvier.
 -- The attorney at law answers to the procurator of the civilians,
to the solicitor in chancery, and to the proctor in the
ecclesiastical and admiralty courts, and all of these are
comprehended under the more general term lawyer. In Great Britain and
in some states of the United States, attorneys are distinguished from
counselors in that the business of the former is to carry on the
practical and formal parts of the suit. In many states of the United
States however, no such distinction exists. In England, since 1873,
attorneys at law are by statute called solicitors. A power, letter,

Defn: An invisible power in a body by which it draws anything to
itself; the power in nature acting mutually between bodies or
ultimate particles, tending to draw them together, or to produce
their cohesion or combination, and conversely resisting separation.

Note: Attraction is exerted at both sensible and insensible
distances, and is variously denominated according to its qualities or
phenomena. Under attraction at sensible distances, there are, --(1.)
Attraction of gravitation, which acts at all distances throughout the
universe, with a force proportional directly to the product of the
masses of the bodies and inversely to the square of their distances
apart. (2.) Magnetic, diamagnetic, and electrical attraction, each of
which is limited in its sensible range and is polar in its action, a
property dependent on the quality or condition of matter, and not on
its quantity. Under attraction at insensible distances, there are, --
(1.) Adhesive attraction, attraction between surfaces of sensible
extent, or by the medium of an intervening substance. (2.) Cohesive
attraction, attraction between ultimate particles, whether like or
unlike, and causing simply an aggregation or a union of those
particles, as in the absorption of gases by charcoal, or of oxygen by
spongy platinum, or the process of solidification or crystallization.
The power in adhesive attraction is strictly the same as that of
cohesion. (3.) Capillary attraction, attraction causing a liquid to
rise, in capillary tubes or interstices, above its level outside, as
in very small glass tubes, or a sponge, or any porous substance, when
one end is inserted in the liquid. It is a special case of cohesive
attraction. (4.) Chemical attraction, or affinity, that peculiar
force which causes elementary atoms, or groups of atoms, to unite to
form molecules.

2. The act or property of attracting; the effect of the power or
operation of attraction. Newton.

3. The power or act of alluring, drawing to, inviting, or engaging;
