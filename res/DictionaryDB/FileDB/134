it so contains it that the two must go together by an indissoluble
connection. War, for example, involves wide spread misery and death;

IRON
I"ron, n. Etym: [OE. iren, AS. iren, isen, isern; akin to D. ijzer,
OS. isarn, OHG. isarn, isan, G. eisen, Icel. isarn, jarn, Sw. & Dan.
jern, and perh. to E. ice; cf. Ir. iarann, W. haiarn, Armor. houarn.]

1. (Chem.)

Defn: The most common and most useful metallic element, being of
almost universal occurrence, usually in the form of an oxide (as
hematite, magnetite, etc.), or a hydrous oxide (as limonite, turgite,
etc.). It is reduced on an enormous scale in three principal forms;
viz., cast iron, steel, and wrought iron. Iron usually appears dark
brown, from oxidation or impurity, but when pure, or an fresh
surface, is a gray or white metal. It is easily oxidized (rusted) by
moisture, and is attacked by many corrosive agents. Symbol Fe (Latin
Ferrum). Atomic weight 55.9. Specific gravity, pure iron, 7.86; cast
iron, 7.1. In magnetic properties, it is superior to all other
substances.

Note: The value of iron is largely due to the facility with which it
can be worked. Thus, when heated it is malleable and ductile, and can
be easily welded and forged at a high temperature. As cast iron, it
is easily fusible; as steel, is very tough, and (when tempered) very
hard and elastic. Chemically, iron is grouped with cobalt and nickel.
Steel is a variety of iron containing more carbon than wrought iron,
but less that cast iron. It is made either from wrought iron, by
roasting in a packing of carbon (cementation) or from cast iron, by
burning off the impurities in a Bessemer converter (then called
Bessemer steel), or directly from the iron ore (as in the Siemens
rotatory and generating furnace).

2. An instrument or utensil made of iron; -- chiefly in composition;
as, a flatiron, a smoothing iron, etc.
My young soldier, put up your iron. Shak.

3. pl.

Defn: Fetters; chains; handcuffs; manacles.
Four of the sufferers were left to rot in irons. Macaulay.

4. Strength; power; firmness; inflexibility; as, to rule with a rod
of iron. Bar iron. See Wrought iron (below).
 -- Bog iron, bog ore; limonite. See Bog ore, under Bog.
 -- Cast iron (Metal.), an impure variety of iron, containing from
three to six percent of carbon, part of which is united with a part
of the iron, as a carbide, and the rest is uncombined, as graphite.
It there is little free carbon, the product is white iron; if much of
the carbon has separated as graphite, it is called gray iron. See
also Cast iron, in the Vocabulary.
 -- Fire irons. See under Fire, n.
 -- Gray irons. See under Fire, n.
 -- Gray iron. See Cast iron (above).
 -- It irons (Naut.), said of a sailing vessel, when, in tacking, she
comes up head to the wind and will not fill away on either tack.
 -- Magnetic iron. See Magnetite.
 -- Malleable iron (Metal.), iron sufficiently pure or soft to be
capable of extension under the hammer; also, specif., a kind of iron
produced by removing a portion of the carbon or other impurities from
cast iron, rendering it less brittle, and to some extent malleable.
 -- Meteoric iron (Chem.), iron forming a large, and often the chief,
ingredient of meteorites. It invariably contains a small amount of
nickel and cobalt. Cf. Meteorite.
 -- Pig iron, the form in which cast iron is made at the blast
furnace, being run into molds, called pigs.
 -- Reduced iron. See under Reduced.
 -- Specular iron. See Hematite.
 -- Too many irons in the fire, too many objects requiring the
attention at once.
 -- White iron. See Cast iron (above).
 -- Wrought iron (Metal.), the purest form of iron commonly known in
the arts, containing only about half of one per cent of carbon. It is
made either directly from the ore, as in the Catalan forge or
bloomery, or by purifying (puddling) cast iron in a reverberatory
furnace or refinery. It is tough, malleable, and ductile. When formed
into bars, it is called bar iron.
