put" If the vote is in the affirmative, the matter before the body
must be voted upon as it then stands, without further general debate
or the submission of new amendments. In the House of Representatives
of the United States, and generally in America, a negative decision
operates to keep the business before the body as if the motion had
not been made; but in the English Parliament, it operates to postpone
consideration for the day, and until the subject may be again
introduced. In American practice, the object of the motion is to
hasten action, and it is made by a friend of the measure. In English
practice, the object is to get rid of the subject for the time being,
and the motion is made with a purpose of voting against it. Cushing.
