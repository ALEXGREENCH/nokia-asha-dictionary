Syn.
 -- To Appreciate, Estimate, Esteem. Estimate is an act of judgment;
esteem is an act of valuing or prizing, and when applied to
individuals, denotes a sentiment of moral approbation. See Estimate.
Appreciate lies between the two. As compared with estimate, it
supposes a union of sensibility with judgment, producing a nice and
delicate perception. As compared with esteem, it denotes a valuation
of things according to their appropriate and distinctive excellence,
and not simply their moral worth. Thus, with reference to the former
of these (delicate perception), an able writer says. "Women have a
truer appreciation of character than men;" and another remarks, "It
is difficult to appreciate the true force and distinctive sense of
terms which we are every day using." So, also, we speak of the
difference between two things, as sometimes hardly appreciable. With
reference to the latter of these (that of valuation as the result of
a nice perception), we say, "It requires a peculiar cast of character
to appreciate the poetry of Wordsworth;" "He who has no delicacy
himself, can not appreciate it in others;" "The thought of death is
salutary, because it leads us to appreciate worldly things aright."
Appreciate is much used in cases where something is in danger of
being overlooked or undervalued; as when we speak of appreciating the
difficulties of a subject, or the risk of an undertaking. So Lord
Plunket, referring to an "ominous silence" which prevailed among the
Irish peasantry, says, "If you knew now to appreciate that silence,
it is more formidable than the most clamorous opposition." In like
manner, a person who asks some favor of another is apt to say, "I
trust you will appreciate my motives in this request." Here we have
the key to a very frequent use of the word. It is hardly necessary to
say that appreciate looks on the favorable side of things. we never
speak of appreciating a man's faults, but his merits. This idea of
regarding things favorably appears more fully in the word
appreciative; as when we speak of an appreciative audience, or an
appreciative review, meaning one that manifests a quick perception
and a ready valuation of excellence.
