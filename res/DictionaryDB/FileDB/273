extrinsic conditions or influences, but generally by a sudden, rather
than a gradual, development; and in tending in many cases to lose

are natural to typical individuals of the species. Many varieties of

all the forms, including the latter, may rank as Varieties. Thus, the
sapphire is a blue variety, and the ruby a red variety, of corundum;
again, calcite has many Varieties differing in form and structure, as
Iceland spar, dogtooth spar, satin spar, and also others
characterized by the presence of small quantities of magnesia, iron,

 -- Variety, Diversity. A man has a variety of employments when he
does many things which are not a mere repetition of the same act; he
has a diversity of employments when the several acts performed are
unlike each other, that is, diverse. In most cases, where there is

who sells railroad tickets performs a great variety of acts in a day,
while there is but little diversity in his employment.

also Phanerogamia).

Defn: Plants having distinct flowers and true seeds. { 1.
Dicotyledons (called also Exogens).
 -- Seeds with two or more cotyledons. Stems with the pith, woody
fiber, and bark concentrically arranged. Divided into two subclasses:
Angiosperms, having the woody fiber interspersed with dotted or
annular ducts, and the seed contained in a true ovary; Gymnosperms,
having few or no ducts in the woody fiber, and the seeds naked. 2.
Monocotyledons (called also Endogens).
 -- Seeds with single cotyledon. Stems with slender bundles of woody
fiber not concentrically arranged, and with no true bark.} II.
Cryptogamia.

Defn: Plants without true flowers, and reproduced by minute spores of
various kinds, or by simple cell division. { 1. Acrogens.
 -- Plants usually with distinct stems and leaves, existing in two
alternate conditions, one of which is nonsexual and sporophoric, the
other sexual and oöphoric. Divided into Vascular Acrogens, or
Pteridophyta, having the sporophoric plant conspicuous and consisting
partly of vascular tissue, as in Ferns, Lycopods, and Equiseta, and
Cellular Acrogens, or Bryophyta, having the sexual plant most
conspicuous, but destitute of vascular tissue, as in Mosses and Scale
Mosses. 2. Thallogens.
 -- Plants without distinct stem and leaves, consisting of a simple
or branched mass of cellular tissue, or educed to a single cell.
Reproduction effected variously. Divided into Algæ, which contain
chlorophyll or its equivalent, and which live upon air and water, and
Fungi, which contain no chlorophyll, and live on organic matter.
(Lichens are now believed to be fungi parasitic on included algæ.}

Note: Many botanists divide the Phænogamia primarily into Gymnosperms
and Angiosperms, and the latter into Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons.
Others consider Pteridophyta and Bryophyta to be separate classes.
Thallogens are variously divided by different writers, and the places
for diatoms, slime molds, and stoneworts are altogether uncertain.
For definitions, see these names in the Vocabulary.

space are described in each successive unit of time.
 -- Variable velocity, velocity in which the space described varies
from instant, either increasing or decreasing; -- in the former case
called accelerated velocity, in the latter, retarded velocity; the
acceleration or retardation itself being also either uniform or
variable.
 -- Virtual velocity. See under Virtual.

Note: In variable velocity, the velocity, strictly, at any given
instant, is the rate of motion at that instant, and is expressed by
the units of space, which, if the velocity at that instant were
continued uniform during a unit of time, would be described in the
unit of time; thus, the velocity of a falling body at a given instant
is the number of feet which, if the motion which the body has at that
instant were continued uniformly for one second, it would pass
through in the second. The scientific sense of velocity differs from
the popular sense in being applied to all rates of motion, however
slow, while the latter implies more or less rapidity or quickness of
motion.

Syn.
 -- Swiftness; celerity; rapidity; fleetness; speed.
