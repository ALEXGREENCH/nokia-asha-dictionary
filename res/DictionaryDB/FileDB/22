Syn.
 -- To Beg, Ask, Request. To ask (not in the sense of inquiring) is
the generic term which embraces all these words. To request is only a
polite mode of asking. To beg, in its original sense, was to ask with
earnestness, and implied submission, or at least deference. At
present, however, in polite life, beg has dropped its original
meaning, and has taken the place of both ask and request, on the
ground of its expressing more of deference and respect. Thus, we beg
a person's acceptance of a present; we beg him to favor us with his
company; a tradesman begs to announce the arrival of new goods, etc.
Crabb remarks that, according to present usage, "we can never talk of
asking a person's acceptance of a thing, or of asking him to do us a
favor." This can be more truly said of usage in England than in
America.
