Defn: A wheel with a broad rim, or grooved rim, for transmitting
power from, or imparting power to, the different parts of machinery,
or for changing the direction of motion, by means of a belt, cord,
rope, or chain.

Note: The pulley, as one of the mechanical powers, consists, in its
simplest form, of a grooved wheel, called a sheave, turning within a
movable frame or block, by means of a cord or rope attached at one
end to a fixed point. The force, acting on the free end of the rope,
is thus doubled, but can move the load through only half the space
traversed by itself. The rope may also pass over a sheave in another
block that is fixed. The end of the rope may be fastened to the
movable block, instead of a fixed point, with an additional gain of
power, and using either one or two sheaves in the fixed block. Other
sheaves may be added, and the power multiplied accordingly. Such an
apparatus is called by workmen a block and tackle, or a fall and
tackle. See Block. A single fixed pulley gives no increase of power,
but serves simply for changing the direction of motion. Band pulley,
or Belt pulley, a pulley with a broad face for transmitting power

to beat, strike; cf. Gr. Appeal, Compel, Impel, Push.]

1. (Physiol.)

Defn: The beating or throbbing of the heart or blood vessels,
especially of the arteries.

Note: In an artery the pulse is due to the expansion and contraction
of the elastic walls of the artery by the action of the heart upon
the column of blood in the arterial system. On the commencement of
the diastole of the ventricle, the semilunar valves are closed, and
the aorta recoils by its elasticity so as to force part of its
contents into the vessels farther onwards. These, in turn, as they
already contain a certain quantity of blood, expand, recover by an
elastic recoil, and transmit the movement with diminished intensity.
Thus a series of movements, gradually diminishing in intensity, pass
along the arterial system (see the Note under Heart). For the sake of
convenience, the radial artery at the wrist is generally chosen to
detect the precise character of the pulse. The pulse rate varies with
age, position, sex, stature, physical and psychical influences, etc.

2. Any measured or regular beat; any short, quick motion, regularly
repeated, as of a medium in the transmission of light, sound, etc.;
