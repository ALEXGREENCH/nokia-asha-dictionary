E

1. The fifth letter of the English alphabet.

Note: It derives its form, name, and value from the Latin, the form
and value being further derived from the Greek, into which it came
from the Phoenician, and ultimately, probably, from the Egyptian. Its
etymological relations are closest with the vowels i, a, and o, as
illustrated by to fall, to fell; man, pl. men; drink, drank, drench;
dint, dent; doom, deem; goose, pl. geese; beef, OF. boef, L. bos; and
E. cheer, OF. chiere, LL. cara.

Note: The letter e has in English several vowel sounds, the two
principal being its long or name sound, as in eve, me, and the short,
as in end, best. Usually at the end of words it is silent, but serves
to indicate that the preceding vowel has its long sound, where
otherwise it would be short, as in mane, as in cane, m, which without
the final e would be pronounced m, c, m. After c and g, the final e
indicates that these letters are to be pronounced as s and j;
respectively, as in lace, rage. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 74-97.

ausis, Russ. ukho, Gr. audire to hear, Gr. av to favor , protect. Cf.
Auricle, Orillon.]

1. The organ of hearing; the external ear.

Note: In man and the higher vertebrates, the organ of hearing is very
complicated, and is divisible into three parts: the external ear,
which includes the pinna or auricle and meatus or external opening;
the middle ear, drum, or tympanum; and the internal ear, or
labyrinth. The middle ear is a cavity connected by the Eustachian
tube with the pharynx, separated from the opening of the external ear
by the tympanic membrane, and containing a chain of three small
bones, or ossicles, named malleus, incus, and stapes, which connect
this membrane with the internal ear. The essential part of the
internal ear where the fibers of the auditory nerve terminate, is the
membranous labyrinth, a complicated system of sacs and tubes filled
with a fluid (the endolymph), and lodged in a cavity, called the bony
labyrinth, in the periotic bone. The membranous labyrinth does not
completely fill the bony labyrinth, but is partially suspended in it
in a fluid (the perilymph). The bony labyrinth consists of a central
cavity, the vestibule, into which three semicircular canals and the
canal of the cochlea (spirally coiled in mammals) open. The
vestibular portion of the membranous labyrinth consists of two sacs,
the utriculus and sacculus, connected by a narrow tube, into the
former of which three membranous semicircular canals open, while the
latter is connected with a membranous tube in the cochlea containing
the organ of Corti. By the help of the external ear the sonorous
vibrations of the air are concentrated upon the tympanic membrane and
set it vibrating, the chain of bones in the middle ear transmits
these vibrations to the internal ear, where they cause certain
delicate structures in the organ of Corti, and other parts of the
membranous labyrinth, to stimulate the fibers of the auditory nerve
to transmit sonorous impulses to the brain.

2. The sense of hearing; the perception of sounds; the power of
discriminating between different tones; as, a nice ear for music; --
in the singular only.
Songs . . . not all ungrateful to thine ear. Tennyson.

3. That which resembles in shape or position the ear of an animal;
any prominence or projection on an object, -- usually one for support
or attachment; a lug; a handle; as, the ears of a tub, a skillet, or

EASTERN CHURCH
Eastern Church.

Defn: That portion of the Christian church which prevails in the
countries once comprised in the Eastern Roman Empire and the
countries converted to Christianity by missionaries from them. Its
full official title is The Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Eastern
Church. It became estranged from the Western, or Roman, Church over
the question of papal supremacy and the doctrine of the filioque, and
a separation, begun in the latter part of the 9th century, became
final in 1054. The Eastern Church consists of twelve (thirteen if the
Bulgarian Church be included) mutually independent churches
(including among these the Hellenic Church, or Church of Greece, and
the Russian Church), using the vernacular (or some ancient form of
it) in divine service and varying in many points of detail, but
standing in full communion with each other and united as equals in a
great federation. The highest five authorities are the patriarch of
Constantinople, or ecumenical patriarch (whose position is not one of
supremacy, but of precedence), the patriarch of Alexandria, the
patriarch of Jerusalem, the patriarch of Antioch, and the Holy Synod
of Russia. The Eastern Church accepts the first seven ecumenical
councils (and is hence styled only schismatic, not heretical, by the
Roman Catholic Church), has as its creed the Niceno-
Constantinopolitan (without the later addition of the filioque,
which, with the doctrine it represents, the church decisively
rejects), baptizes infants with trine immersion, makes confirmation
follow immediately upon baptism, administers the Communion in both
kinds (using leavened bread) and to infants as well as adults,
permits its secular clergy to marry before ordination and to keep
their wives afterward, but not to marry a second time, selects its
bishops from the monastic clergy only, recognizes the offices of
bishop, priest, and deacon as the three necessary degrees of orders,
venerates relics and icons, and has an elaborate ritual.
