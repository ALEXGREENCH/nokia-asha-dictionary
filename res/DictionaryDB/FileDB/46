Syn.
 -- To Coerce, Compel. To compel denotes to urge on by force which
cannot be resisted. The term aplies equally to physical and moral
force; as, compelled by hunger; compelled adverse circumstances;
compelled by parental affection. Coerce had at first only the
negative sense of checking or restraining by force; as, to coerce a
bad man by punishments or a prisoner with fetters. It has now gained
a positive sense., viz., that of driving a person into the
performance of some act which is required of him by another; as, to
coerce a man to sign a contract; to coerce obedience. In this sense

Defn: The application to another of either physical or moral force.
When the force is physical, and cannot be resisted, then the act
produced by it is a nullity, so far as concerns the party coerced.
When the force is moral, then the act, though voidable, is imputable
to the party doing it, unless he be so paralyzed by terror as to act
convulsively. At the same time coercion is not negatived by the fact
of submission under force. "Coactus volui" (I consented under
compulsion) is the condition of mind which, when there is volition
forced by coercion, annuls the result of such coercion. Wharton.
