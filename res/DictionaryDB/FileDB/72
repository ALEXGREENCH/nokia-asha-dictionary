disgust, and aversion are more intense phases of dislike. Aversion
denotes a fixed and habitual dislike; as, an aversion to or for

hostility something proposed (repugnance being the stronger); as, a
reluctance to make the necessary sacrifices, and a repugnance to the
submission required. Disgust is repugnance either of taste or moral
feeling; as, a disgust at gross exhibitions of selfishness. Antipathy
is primarily an instinctive feeling of dislike of a thing, such as
most persons feel for a snake. When used figuratively, it denotes a
correspondent dislike for certain persons, modes of acting, etc. Men
have an aversion to what breaks in upon their habits; a reluctance
and repugnance to what crosses their will; a disgust at what offends
their sensibilities; and are often governed by antipathies for which
they can give no good reason.
