as one which is caught from another by contact, by the breath, by
bodily effluvia, etc.; while an infectious disease supposes some
entirely different cause acting by a hidden influence, like the
miasma of prison ships, of marshes, etc., infecting the system with
disease. "This distinction, though not universally admitted by
medical men, as to the literal meaning, of the words, certainly
applies to them in their figurative use. Thus we speak of the
contagious influence of evil associates; their contagion of bad
example, the contagion of fear, etc., when we refer to transmission
by proximity or contact. On the other hand, we speak of infection by
bad principles, etc., when we consider anything as diffused by some
hidden influence.

sound, are sometimes erroneously interchanged, as when a person
speaks of having "a very contemptible opinion of another."
Contemptible is applied to that which is the object of contempt; as,
contemptible conduct; acontemptible fellow. Contemptuous is applied
to that which indicates contempts; as, a contemptuous look; a
contemptuous remark; contemptuous treatment. A person, or whatever is

Syn.
 -- Struggle; strife; contest; quarrel; combat; conflict; feud;

 -- Contention, Strife. A struggle between two parties is the idea
common to these two words. Strife is a struggle for mastery;
contention is a struggle for the possession of some desired object,
or the accomplishment of some favorite end. Neither of the words is
necessairly used in a bad sense, since there may be a generous strife
or contention between two friends as to which shall incur danger or
submit to sacrifices. Ordinarily, however, these words denote a
struggle arising from bad passions. In that case, strife usually
springs from a quarrelsome temper, and contention from, a selfish
spirit which seeks its own aggrandizement, or is fearful lest others
should obtain too such. Strife has more reference to the manner than
to the object of a struggle, while contention takes more account of
the end to be gained.

Syn.
 -- Conflict; combat; battle; encounter; shock; struggle; dispute;
altercation; debate; controvesy; difference; disagreement; strife.
 -- Contest, Conflict, Combat, Encounter. Contest is the broadest
term, and had originally no reference to actual fighting. It was, on
the contrary, a legal term signifying to call witnesses, and hence
came to denote first a struggle in argument, and then a struggle for
some common object between opposing parties, usually one of
considerable duration, and implying successive stages or acts.
Conflict denotes literally a close personal engagement, in which
sense it is applied to actual fighting. It is, however, more commonly
used in a figurative sense to denote strenuous or direct opposition;
as, a mental conflict; conflicting interests or passions; a conflict
of laws. An encounter is a direct meeting face to face. Usually it is
