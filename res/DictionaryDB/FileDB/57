courage in daring acts. Fortitude has often been styled "passive
courage," and consist in the habit of encountering danger and
enduring pain with a steadfast and unbroken spirit. Valor is courage
exhibited in war, and can not be applied to single combats; it is
never used figuratively. Intrepidity is firm, unshaken courage.
Gallantry is adventurous courage, which courts danger with a high and
cheerful spirit. A man may show courage, fortitude, or intrepidity in
the common pursuits of life, as well as in war. Valor, bravery, and
