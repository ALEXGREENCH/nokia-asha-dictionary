Syn.
 -- Debility, Infirmity, Imbecility. An infirmity belongs, for the
most part, to particular members, and is often temporary, as of the

and renders it more or less powerless. Debility may be constitutional
or may be the result or superinduced causes; Imbecility is always
constitutional; infirmity is accidental, and results from sickness or
a decay of the frame. These words, in their figurative uses, have the

and an Imbecility which affects the whole man; but Imbecility is
often used with specific reference to feebleness of mind.

De*ceive", v. t. [imp. & p. p. Deceived; p. pr. & vb. n. Deceiving.]
Etym: [OE. deceveir, F. décevoir, fr. L. decipere to catch, insnare,
deceive; de- + capere to take, catch. See Capable, and cf. Deceit,
Deception.]

Syn.
 -- Deceive, Delude, Mislead. Deceive is a general word applicable to
any kind of misrepresentation affecting faith or life. To delude,
primarily, is to make sport of, by deceiving, and is accomplished by
playing upon one's imagination or credulity, as by exciting false
hopes, causing him to undertake or expect what is impracticable, and
making his failure ridiculous. It implies some infirmity of judgment
in the victim, and intention to deceive in the deluder. But it is
often used reflexively, indicating that a person's own weakness has
made him the sport of others or of fortune; as, he deluded himself
with a belief that luck would always favor him. To mislead is to
lead, guide, or direct in a wrong way, either willfully or
ignorantly.

DECEIVER
De*ceiv"er, n.

Defn: One who deceives; one who leads into error; a cheat; an

Syn.
 -- Deceiver, Impostor. A deceiver operates by stealth and in private
upon individuals; an impostor practices his arts on the community at
large. The one succeeds by artful falsehoods, the other by bold
assumption. The faithless friend and the fickle lover are deceivers;
the false prophet and the pretended prince are impostors.

Syn.
 -- Deception, Deceit, Fraud, Imposition. Deception usually refers to

person as skilled in deception and addicted to deceit. The practice
of deceit springs altogether from design, and that of the worst kind;
but a deception does not always imply aim and intention. It may be
undesigned or accidental. An imposition is an act of deception
practiced upon some one to his annoyance or injury; a fraud implies

2. Free from doubt or wavering; determined; of fixed purpose; fully
settled; positive; resolute; as, a decided opinion or purpose.

Syn.
 -- Decided, Decisive. We call a thing decisive when it has the power
or quality of deciding; as, a decisive battle; we speak of it as
decided when it is so fully settled as to leave no room for doubt;
as, a decided preference, a decided aversion. Hence, a decided
victory is one about which there is no question; a decisive victory
is one which ends the contest. Decisive is applied only to things;
as, a decisive sentence, a decisive decree, a decisive judgment.
Decided is applied equally to persons and things. Thus we speak of a
man as decided in his whole of conduct; and as having a decided
disgust, or a decided reluctance, to certain measures. "A politic

Syn.
 -- Decision, Determination, Resolution. Each of these words has two
meanings, one implying the act of deciding, determining, or
resolving; and the other a habit of mind as to doing. It is in the
last sense that the words are here compared. Decision is a cutting
short. It implies that several courses of action have been presented
to the mind, and that the choice is now finally made. It supposes,
therefore, a union of promptitude and energy. Determination is the
natural consequence of decision. It is the settling of a thing with a
fixed purpose to adhere. Resolution is the necessary result in a mind
which is characterized by firmness. It is a spirit which scatters
(resolves) all doubt, and is ready to face danger or suffering in
carrying out one's determinations. Martin Luther was equally
distinguished for his prompt decision, his steadfast determination,
and his inflexible resolution.

 -- Decline, Decay, Consumption. Decline marks the first stage in a
downward progress; decay indicates the second stage, and denotes a
tendency to ultimate destruction; consumption marks a steady decay
from an internal exhaustion of strength. The health may experience a
decline from various causes at any period of life; it is naturally
subject to decay with the advance of old age; consumption may take
place at almost any period of life, from disease which wears out the
constitution. In popular language decline is often used as synonymous
with consumption. By a gradual decline, states and communities lose
their strength and vigor; by progressive decay, they are stripped of
their honor, stability, and greatness; by a consumption of their
resources and vital energy, they are led rapidly on to a completion
of their existence.
