1. A sweet white (or brownish yellow) crystalline substance, of a
sandy or granular consistency, obtained by crystallizing the
evaporated juice of certain plants, as the sugar cane, sorghum, beet
root, sugar maple, etc. It is used for seasoning and preserving many
kinds of food and drink. Ordinary sugar is essentially sucrose. See
the Note below.

Note: The term sugar includes several commercial grades, as the white
or refined, granulated, loaf or lump, and the raw brown or muscovado.
In a more general sense, it includes several distinct chemical
compounds, as the glucoses, or grape sugars (including glucose
proper, dextrose, and levulose), and the sucroses, or true sugars (as
cane sugar). All sugars are carbohydrates. See Carbohydrate. The
glucoses, or grape sugars, are ketone alcohols of the formula
C6H12O6, and they turn the plane of polarization to the right or the
left. They are produced from the amyloses and sucroses, as by the
action of heat and acids of ferments, and are themselves decomposed
by fermentation into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The only sugar
(called acrose) as yet produced artificially belongs to this class.
The sucroses, or cane sugars, are doubled glucose anhydrides of the
formula C12H22O11. They are usually not fermentable as such (cf.
Sucrose), and they act on polarized light.

2. By extension, anything resembling sugar in taste or appearance;
as, sugar of lead (lead acetate), a poisonous white crystalline
substance having a sweet taste.

3. Compliment or flattery used to disguise or render acceptable
something obnoxious; honeyed or soothing words. [Colloq.] Acorn
sugar. See Quercite.
