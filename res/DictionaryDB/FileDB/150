MACHINE
Ma*chine", n. Etym: [F., fr. L. machina machine, engine, device,

1. In general, any combination of bodies so connected that their
relative motions are constrained, and by means of which force and
motion may be transmitted and modified, as a screw and its nut, or a
lever arranged to turn about a fulcrum or a pulley about its pivot,
etc.; especially, a construction, more or less complex, consisting of
a combination of moving parts, or simple mechanical elements, as
wheels, levers, cams, etc., with their supports and connecting
framework, calculated to constitute a prime mover, or to receive
force and motion from a prime mover or from another machine, and
transmit, modify, and apply them to the production of some desired
mechanical effect or work, as weaving by a loom, or the excitation of
electricity by an electrical machine.

Note: The term machine is most commonly applied to such pieces of
mechanism as are used in the industrial arts, for mechanically
shaping, dressing, and combining materials for various purposes, as
in the manufacture of cloth, etc. Where the effect is chemical, or

apparatus, not a machine; as, a bleaching apparatus. Many large,
powerful, or specially important pieces of mechanism are called
engines; as, a steam engine, fire engine, graduating engine, etc.

engine and machine among practical men, there is a tendency to
restrict the application of the former to contrivances in which the
operating part is not distinct from the motor.
