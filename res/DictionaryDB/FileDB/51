we mean simply to imply that others may perhaps think us in the
wrong, and hence we use the words by way of deference to their
opinions. It was in this way that the early Christians were led to
use the Latin confiteor and confessio fidei to denote the public
declaration of their faith in Christianity; and hence the
corresponding use in English of the verb confess and the noun
confession.
