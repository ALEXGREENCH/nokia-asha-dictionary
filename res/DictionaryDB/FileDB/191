POST-IMPRESSIONISM
Post`-im*pres"sion*ism, n. (Painting)

Defn: In the broadest sense, the theory or practice of any of several
groups of recent painters, or of these groups taken collectively,
whose work and theories have in common a tendency to reaction against
the scientific and naturalistic character of impressionism and neo-
impressionism. In a strict sense the term post-impressionism is used
to denote the effort at self-expression, rather than representation,
shown in the work of Cézanne, Matisse, etc.; but it is more broadly
used to include cubism, the theory or practice of a movement in both
painting and  sculpture which lays stress upon volume as the
important attribute of objects and attempts its expression by the use
of geometrical figures or solids only; and futurism, a theory or
practice which attempts to place the observer within the picture and
to represent simultaneously a number of consecutive movements and
impressions. In practice these theories and methods of the post-
impressionists change with great rapidity and shade into one another,
so that a picture may be both cubist and futurist in character. They
tend to, and sometimes reach, a condition in which both
representation and traditional decoration are entirely abolished and
a work of art becomes a purely subjective expression in an arbitrary
and personal language.
