which answers the question "How much"; measure in regard to bulk or
amount; determinate or comparative dimensions; measure; amount; bulk;
extent; size. Hence, in specific uses:
(a) (Logic) The extent or extension of a general conception, that is,
the number of species or individuals to which it may be applied;
also, its content or comprehension, that is, the number of its
constituent qualities, attributes, or relations.
(b) (Gram.) The measure of a syllable; that which determines the time
in which it is pronounced; as, the long or short quantity of a vowel
or syllable.
(c) (Mus.) The relative duration of a tone.

2. That which can be increased, diminished, or measured; especially
(Math.), anything to which mathematical processes are applicable.

Note: Quantity is discrete when it is applied to separate objects, as
in number; continuous, when the parts are connected, either in
succession, as in time, motion, etc., or in extension, as by the
dimensions of space, viz., length, breadth, and thickness.

3. A determinate or estimated amount; a sum or bulk; a certain
portion or part; sometimes, a considerable amount; a large portion,
bulk, or sum; as, a medicine taken in quantities, that is, in large

 -- Quantity of motion (Mech.), in a body, the relative amount of its
motion, as measured by its momentum, varying as the product of mass
and velocity.
 -- Known quantities (Math.), quantities whose values are given.
 -- Unknown quantities (Math.), quantities whose values are sought.
