 -- Authentic, Genuine. These words, as here compared, have reference
to historical documents. We call a document genuine when it can be
traced back ultimately to the author or authors from whom it
professes to emanate. Hence, the word has the meaning, "not changed
from the original, uncorrupted, unadulterated:" as, a genuine text.
We call a document authentic when, on the ground of its being thus
traced back, it may be relied on as true and authoritative (from the
primary sense of "having an author, vouched for"); hence its extended
signification, in general literature, of trustworthy, as resting on
unquestionable authority or evidence; as, an authentic history; an
authentic report of facts.
A genuine book is that which was written by the person whose name it
bears, as the author of it. An authentic book is that which relates
matters of fact as they really happened. A book may be genuine
without being, authentic, and a book may be authentic without being
genuine. Bp. Watson.

Note: It may be said, however, that some writers use authentic (as,
an authentic document) in the sense of "produced by its professed
author, not counterfeit."
