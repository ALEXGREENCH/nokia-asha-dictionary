Note: The general direction of the trade winds is from N. E. to S. W.
on the north side of the equator, and from S. E. to N. W. on the

heating, rarefaction, and consequent ascent of the air in the latter
regions. The trade winds are principally limited to two belts in the
tropical regions, one on each side of the equator, and separated by a
belt which is characterized by calms or variable weather.

Syn.
 -- Transcendental, Empirical. These terms, with the corresponding
nouns, transcendentalism and empiricism, are of comparatively recent
origin. Empirical refers to knowledge which is gained by the
experience of actual phenomena, without reference to the principles
or laws to which they are to be referred, or by which they are to be
explained. Transcendental has reference to those beliefs or
principles which are not derived from experience, and yet are
absolutely necessary to make experience possible or useful. Such, in
the better sense of the term, is the transcendental philosophy, or
transcendentalism. Each of these words is also used in a bad sense,
empiricism applying to that one-sided view of knowledge which
neglects or loses sight of the truths or principles referred to
above, and trusts to experience alone; transcendentalism, to the
opposite extreme, which, in its deprecation of experience, loses
sight of the relations which facts and phenomena sustain to
principles, and hence to a kind of philosophy, or a use of language,
which is vague, obscure, fantastic, or extravagant.
