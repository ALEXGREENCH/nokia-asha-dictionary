Note: In the scholastic philosophy, the species was sensible and

which was in fact discerned by the mind through the organ of
perception, or that in any object which rendered it possible that it
should be perceived. The sensible species, as apprehended by the

2. (Logic)

conception, called a genus, or generic conception, from which it

genus; and man, in its turn, may be regarded as a genus with respect

a species. In zoölogy and botany, a species is an ideal group of
individuals which are believed to have descended from common
ancestors, which agree in essential characteristics, and are capable
of indefinitely continued fertile reproduction through the sexes. A
species, as thus defined, differs from a variety or subspecies only
in the greater stability of its characters and in the absence of
individuals intermediate between the related groups.

of generosity; a species of cloth.
